# Mr Game and Sweat - Jekyll Based Video Game Review Website

#### How to Use
If you aren’t familiar with Jekyll yet, you should know that it is a static site generator. It will transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. No more databases, slow loading websites, risk of being hacked… just your content. And not only that, with Jekyll you get free hosting with GitHub Pages!

Run locally: 
`jekyll serve --watch`
