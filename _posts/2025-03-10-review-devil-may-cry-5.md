# Devil May Cry 5 Review

With its stunning visuals, engaging combat mechanics, and a rich narrative steeped in action-packed lore, "Devil May Cry 5" has earned its place as a classic in the hack-and-slash genre. However, for those of you who like to combine your gaming with exercising—especially on a treadmill or bike—let's break down how well this game holds up in that regard.

# Gameplay

Devil May Cry 5 excels in providing fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping gameplay, where players can quickly switch between characters and engage in dynamic combat. The fluidity and variety of the combat moves keep you on your toes, which can work wonders for maintaining your focus during a workout session. Each mission flows beautifully, with only minimal traditional downtime. While the game does feature cutscenes to deepen the story, they are generally not long enough to distract you significantly from your running or biking. You'll find yourself immersed, but with plenty of opportunities to jump right back into the action. 

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Devil May Cry 5 shines in this category as well. It supports both controller and keyboard inputs, making it adaptable for various setups. The gameplay requires a mix of timing and precision rather than quick twitch movements, which suits the more steady motions of running or cycling. While some boss battles may demand a bit more concentration, the overall pace of the game complements a workout rather than hindering it. The combat’s engaging nature will keep your mind off the burn in your legs or the rhythm of your breath, which is a plus for endurance workouts.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

In terms of computer requirements, Devil May Cry 5 is reasonably demanding but not prohibitively so. A mid-range gaming PC should handle it comfortably, provided you have a decent graphics card. The game boasts beautiful graphics and great performance, so if you're using a high-performance setup, you're in for a treat. Just keep in mind that if your system struggles, it may slow down your gameplay experience, thereby potentially interrupting your workout focus.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In summary, "Devil May Cry 5" offers fast-paced, exciting gameplay that complements exercise very well. Its adaptability to workout scenarios on treadmills or bikes is a significant highlight, and while it does have some minor cutscenes, they aren't a deal-breaker. As for computer performance, it’s manageable, making it a realistic option for many gamers. Despite a few minor bumps, this game encourages players to push themselves—not only in the game but also during their workouts.

### Overall Score: 2.5 out of 3
