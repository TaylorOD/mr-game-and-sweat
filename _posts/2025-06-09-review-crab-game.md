# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

In terms of compatibility, Crab Game performs reasonably well for treadmill and bike users. The game primarily requires you to use a simple keyboard and mouse or a controller. While it does incorporate elements of quick agile movement for navigating the playground of death, the reliance on directional control means you can easily adjust your gameplay focus to accommodate your exercise routine. However, if you lean toward highly competitive sessions, the quick reflexes required may demand a bit more concentration, which could take away from your workout.

This aspect makes it easy to fit into a gaming setup where you may also have your exercise equipment plugged in and ready to go.
