# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Tomb Raider stands out in terms of compatibility with treadmills and bikes. The game works beautifully with most controller setups, allowing you to maintain your rhythm without needing to fumble for keyboard keys. The control mechanics are well-designed for a more leisurely pace—perfect for casual jogging or cycling. While some combat segments may require quick reflexes and movement, overall, the game doesn't overwhelm your coordination, making it accessible for players focused on maintaining a steady cardio session.

On the technical side, the game offers a beautiful visual experience but may require a moderately powerful computer to run steadily. The system requirements are relatively reasonable; however, if you aim for higher graphical settings, a robust graphics card will enhance the experience. For the most part, Tomb Raider should run well on mid-range systems, but players with older hardware might find themselves adjusting settings to achieve a smoother gameplay experience.
