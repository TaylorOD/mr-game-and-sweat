Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Undertale,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Undertale Game Review

Undertale, created by Toby Fox, is a unique RPG that defies the conventional mechanics of traditional games while delivering a compelling narrative and memorable characters. As a fitness-focused gamer, I’ll delve into its mechanics and see how it fares as a companion for your treadmill runs and bike rides.

# Gameplay

Undertale’s gameplay thrives on its innovative battle system that allows players to engage in combat or opt for peaceful resolutions, with choices heavily influencing the story. The turn-based mechanics are engaging but offer a fair amount of downtime for decision making. Most combat sequences involve dodging projectiles and responding under pressure, keeping you entertained while you exercise. The combination of humor, captivating music, and emotional undertones throughout the gameplay keeps your attention, which can help stave off boredom during longer runs or rides. However, certain segments involve dialogue and cutscenes that can feel lengthy, possibly interrupting your exercise rhythm. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility, Undertale shines with controller support, allowing you to set your device down without needing to focus on keyboard inputs while you exercise. The turn-based nature of the combat means you won’t need to rely on quick reflexes or rapid button mashing, making it easier to maintain your focus on your workout while playing. However, there are moments in the game where concentration on the screen is necessary, particularly during boss fights, which might momentarily distract you from your physical activity. Overall, it strikes a balance but should be approached mindfully.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Undertale is not demanding on computer resources, making it accessible for a range of systems. It can run smoothly on older hardware and doesn't require extensive graphical capabilities, allowing you to focus on your workout rather than worrying about lag or performance issues. This makes it an ideal option for gamers who want an easy setup next to their equipment without the fuss.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Undertale is an engaging and charming indie RPG that offers a rich experience and entertaining gameplay while fitting reasonably well into an exercise schedule. While it might not completely align with high-intensity workouts due to some slower segments, its overall flexibility and low computer demands enhance its attractiveness as a fitness-friendly game. 

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
