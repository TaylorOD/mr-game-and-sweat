# Resident Evil 3 Game Review

Resident Evil 3, a remake of the classic survival horror game, adapts the frantic, zombie-filled atmosphere with modern mechanics and visuals. But how does it fare for those looking to combine exercise with their gaming experience? Let's dive into the specifics.

# Gameplay

Resident Evil 3 is a thrill ride packed with intense action, puzzles, and atmosphere that can keep your adrenaline pumping. The fast-paced nature of the game is engaging and encourages you to stay on your toes—literally. It does maintain a balance of tense moments with bursts of action, but long cutscenes and some slower sequences can break your immersion, potentially leading to some frustration while on a treadmill or bike. Thankfully, the action-heavy sequences often overshadow these slower parts, making it relatively easy to stay engaged during your workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

The game allows for smooth controller compatibility, so if you're set up with a controller while on your treadmill or bike, you won't have to worry about fumbling with your keyboard and mouse. However, certain moments demand quick reflexes and fast movements, especially during chase scenes with the iconic Nemesis. This can pose a challenge when trying to maintain a steady pace on your equipment, potentially pulling your focus away from exercising. While you can manage, don’t expect a completely seamless experience.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Resident Evil 3 is well-optimized for modern systems, but it still requires a decent setup to run smoothly. Minimum specifications include an Intel Core i5-4460 or AMD FX-6300 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a GTX 760 or Radeon R7 260 graphics card. Higher settings will push these requirements further, thus potentially limiting your ability to multitask with intensive gaming and exercising comfortably. Make sure your system is up to the challenge if you want some immersive horror while working up a sweat!

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In summary, Resident Evil 3 offers an engaging and intense gameplay experience that keeps your heart racing as you navigate the horrors of Raccoon City. While there are slow moments and some demand for quick reactions, it strikes a commendable balance for those wanting a thrilling workout. Just ensure your gaming setup is sturdy enough to support both your gaming and fitness goals.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
