Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Kingdom Come: Deliverance,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Kingdom Come: Deliverance - Game Review

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an intensive role-playing game (RPG) set in the 15th century Kingdom of Bohemia. It’s known for its historical authenticity and deep immersive experience, but how well does it fare for those looking to combine their cardio workouts with gameplay? Let's dive into our review based on key categories.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Kingdom Come: Deliverance is richly detailed and engaging, with an expansive open world that offers various quests and exploration opportunities. Players are thrust into a life of a blacksmith’s son whose village has been ravaged by invading forces. The quests are often lengthy and filled with dialogue, which can detract from the immersive experience if you're trying to maintain a steady pace on your treadmill or bike. The combat system is realistic and requires skill and timing, which means you’ll need to pay attention during these sequences. However, the slower-paced segments and lengthy cutscenes could make it challenging to keep your intensity up while exercising. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

In terms of compatibility with treadmill running or biking, Kingdom Come: Deliverance does present some challenges. The game primarily utilizes a controller, which is beneficial for standing still or adjusting your speed while playing. However, combat and exploration can be demanding in terms of timing and movement control, requiring focus that might not be conducive to a good workout. If you can maintain a moderate jogging pace, you might be able to enjoy the game without getting too distracted, but the occasional need for quick reactions could pose issues for more intense sessions; it's not quite as forgiving as some other workout-friendly titles.

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Kingdom Come: Deliverance is quite demanding regarding computer specifications. It requires a minimum of a dual-core CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a graphics card equivalent to an Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 for decent performance. To enjoy the game at higher graphical settings, you’ll likely need even more powerful hardware, which could limit accessibility for some users. Notably, this might be something to consider if you’re aiming to run it concurrently with your treadmill or biking—higher system demands might lead to performance issues if you're not set up with a robust machine.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Kingdom Come: Deliverance successfully immerses players in a stunning historical setting, complete with intricate mechanics and a knack for realism. Yet, as an exercise-friendly title, it falls short due to its pacing and computer demands. While it can keep you entertained with rich storytelling, those serious about workouts might find themselves struggling to maintain their momentum on a treadmill or bike—especially during its slower moments. 

### Overall Score: 1.83 out of 3
