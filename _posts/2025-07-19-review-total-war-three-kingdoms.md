Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Total War: THREE KINGDOMS Review

Total War: THREE KINGDOMS offers an engaging blend of real-time strategy and turn-based gameplay wrapped in a rich historical context. Players dive into the tumultuous eras of ancient China, where they can command vast armies, develop intricate strategies, and engage in detailed diplomacy with various factions. 

# Gameplay

The gameplay in THREE KINGDOMS is undeniably engaging, but it teeters on the edge of distraction as you jog or cycle. While the thrill of battle and the challenge of maneuvering troops can certainly pull you into the screen, some of the slow-paced strategic planning and occasionally lengthy cutscenes may disrupt your flow. However, the hours you'll spend conquering and managing your empire will often keep you entertained enough to forget about the sweat on your brow. The tactical depth paired with the immersive storytelling draws you in, yet the moments of downtime might cause you to momentarily zone out while running.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

In terms of treadmill and bike compatibility, THREE KINGDOMS strikes a reasonably good balance. The game is compatible with controllers, allowing for a more relaxed gameplay experience that doesn’t demand lightning-fast reflexes or hyper-focus on precise button presses. The strategic nature means that frequent intense actions are interspersed with downtime, letting you keep a steady pace on your treadmill or bike. That said, some moment-to-moment decisions during combat might require a bit more attention, risking a slip in your stride. Still, it's certainly playable while exercising, making it feasible for a workout routine.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Total War: THREE KINGDOMS is relatively demanding in terms of system requirements. To get the best experience, you'll want a decent gaming rig; the game requires modern processors and ample RAM for smooth performance, particularly during large-scale battles where the dynamics can get quite intense. The visual quality is striking, but that graphical fidelity comes with the trade-off of needing a capable computer. For those with a mid-level system or higher, it runs well and keeps the action fluid, even when the screen is packed with units and glorious animations.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS offers an engaging experience with a historical flair that pulls you into its world while allowing for most treadmill and bike users to enjoy its gameplay. There are moments of distraction, particularly during slower sections, but the overall enjoyment and strategic depth make it worth the occasional pause in motion. If you're looking to blend your love for gaming with exercise, this title is a solid choice, though you may need to balance your attention between the game and your workout.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
