# Middle-earth: Shadow of War - Game Review

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a sequel that follows the successful Shadow of Mordor, further honing its blend of action RPG mechanics and the furious battles of Middle-earth. You might be wondering how it stacks up while you’re trying to maintain your stride on a treadmill or pedal away on your bike. Let’s take a closer look.

## Gameplay

In Shadow of War, players navigate a rich world filled with orc armies, epic battles, and intricate character progression. The fluid combat system offers satisfying animations and seamless transitions between melee, ranged, and special moves. You'll find yourself engaged, especially when you're trying to dominate orc captains or initiate sieges. However, the game features numerous cut scenes and lore-heavy sequences that can slow down the pace. While they offer depth to the story, you may find that long dialogues disrupt your workout rhythm, making it essential to time your exercise sessions carefully.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Shadow of War’s controller compatibility earns it points when it comes to exercising on a treadmill or bike. Its mechanics require moderate inputs, which are manageable as you maintain your momentum. However, the game occasionally demands quick reflexes, particularly during intense combat sequences or escape scenarios, which may lead to jolts of movement that can disrupt your steady pace. Keep a steady hand and focus, and you'll find the gameplay complements your workout without causing too much distraction.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is relatively demanding when it comes to system requirements. It recommends at least an Intel i5-2500K / AMD FX-8320 processor and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 / AMD Radeon HD 7950 for smooth gameplay. While many systems these days can handle such specs, if you're working with an older setup, you may face performance issues. Ensure your rig is up to the task to avoid frame drops that could take away from your gaming and exercising experience.

### Category Score: 1 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Overall, Middle-earth: Shadow of War offers an engaging experience that brilliantly combines action and story. However, the frequent cut scenes and occasional need for quick reflexes might interrupt your workout routine. Pairing the game with a solid exercise strategy and awareness of when to focus could lead to a successful treadmill or biking session. 

### Overall Score: 1.67 out of 3
