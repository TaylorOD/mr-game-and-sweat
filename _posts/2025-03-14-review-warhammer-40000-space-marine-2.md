# Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Review

Prepare yourself for a gripping excursion into the grim darkness of the distant future with "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2." As a sequel to the beloved original, this title not only immerses players in its lore but does so with mechanics that lend themselves surprisingly well to those who prefer to combine their gaming with physical activity. 

# Gameplay

In "Space Marine 2," the gameplay is a relentless barrage of thrilling action. The core mechanics focus on fast-paced combat, allowing you to dismember foes with both finesse and brute force, utilising a variety of melee and ranged weapons. The pacing of the game is well-balanced, with engaging skirmishes that rarely feel monotonous and enough variety in enemy types to keep you on your toes. The levels are designed with flow in mind, encouraging players to engage with enemies rather than sit through long cutscenes or tedious exploration. However, there are occasional narrative segments that slow down the action, but they're brief and effectively set the tone for the unfolding chaos. Overall, the adrenaline level stays high, making it suitable for those looking to keep up their heart rates while exercising.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with treadmills and bikes, "Space Marine 2" performs admirably. The game supports controller input, so you can easily adjust your setup to keep your arms engaged as you run or bike. The action doesn't require rapid, twitchy movements, which often leads to awkward balancing—most combat can be handled effectively with comfortable thumbstick maneuvering. The simple controls also don't demand much finesse, allowing you to focus on your workout rather than being glued to a chair. This means you can keep your legs moving while unleashing a barrage of firepower on the forces of chaos without missing a beat.

### Category Score: 2.8 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The graphics engine in "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2" is undoubtedly cutting-edge, with spectacular visuals and expansive environments. However, this comes at a price—your hardware will need to be fairly robust. While the game is optimized to run on mid-range PCs, those with lower specs may experience dips in performance during intense action sequences. It's advisable to have at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 paired with a GTX 1060 or equivalent to get the best experience. Ensuring stable frames-per-second (FPS) while you’re exercising will be crucial to maintaining your immersion and performance.

### Category Score: 2.2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In summary, "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2" is a captivating sequel that successfully balances action with the ability to keep your body engaged while gaming. With a few minor foibles in pacing and hardware requirements, it stands as a must-try for anyone looking to integrate exercise with gaming. Whether you're mowing down hordes of enemies or delving into the rich Warhammer lore, this game compels you to keep moving, making it a fantastic option for treadmill and bike enthusiasts alike.
