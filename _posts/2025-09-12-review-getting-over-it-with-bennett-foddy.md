# Gameplay

# Game Review: Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy

**Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy** is a unique experience that combines a philosophical meditation on the nature of failure with an infuriatingly engaging gameplay loop. As players control the character—an individual stuck in a cauldron using a hammer to propel upward—every facet of the game is designed to challenge both your patience and coordination. For fitness enthusiasts looking to combine gameplay with exercise, this game offers an experience unlike any other, but it's essential to analyze how it holds up in terms of treadmill or biking compatibility.

# Gameplay

In *Getting Over It*, the gameplay revolves around precise movements and incremental progress. Players face a daunting mountain that requires navigating various obstacles with delicate movements. This struggle can be (and often is) maddening, which can make your run or ride feel all the more gratifying when you make those hard-earned strides forward. The game features no slow sections or drawn-out cutscenes; instead, it is a constant barrage of challenge, keeping you hooked as you break sweats on the treadmill or bike. The lack of interruptions is a plus, allowing players to stay immersed in the challenge rather than feeling distracted or disengaged. However, the game's frustration might lead to overheating during intense moments, necessitating a balance between exercise and gaming enthusiasm.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to integration with treadmill or bike equipment, *Getting Over It* can present some challenges. The game requires the player to utilize a mouse or controller, increasing the need for precise, often quick movements to navigate obstacles. This can indeed lead to a clash of focus; trying to maintain balance while also executing intricate motions with your hands can be tricky. Even so, if you're adept at multitasking, you can find a rhythm that allows you to enjoy the game while effectively managing your exercise. Additionally, the slower pacing of playing while running or biking can help to moderate your heart rate during those intense moments of frustration. 

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side, *Getting Over It* is not overly demanding. The game can run smoothly on less powerful systems, making it accessible to a broader audience. This is a major plus for those who don't have gaming rigs but would still like to engage in a light-hearted yet challenging experience while working out. It's ideal for simultaneously running or biking on modest machines, ensuring anyone can partake without a top-tier setup.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

*Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy* offers a challenging yet fresh experience for fitness enthusiasts, keeping you actively engaged without the nuisances of long cutscenes or unnecessary downtime. Despite some hurdles in handling a mouse or controller while maintaining your exercise intensity, it stands out as a fun and engaging way to integrate gaming and fitness. The game's accessibility to less powerful computers also makes it a viable option for a wide audience. For those who relish overcoming hurdles—both in-game and in fitness—this title provides a worthy adventure.
