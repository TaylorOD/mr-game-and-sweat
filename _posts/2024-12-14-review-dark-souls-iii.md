# DARK SOULS III Game Review

Fromsoft’s critically acclaimed title, DARK SOULS III, is a perfect blend of challenging gameplay and breathtaking aesthetics that captures the essence of its dark fantasy world. But how does it fare for gamers looking to integrate physical exercise into their session? Let's delve into the details.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in DARK SOULS III is wholly immersive and engaging. As players traverse the expansive, interconnected environments, each encounter with enemies demands focus and tactical execution. The game thrives on its high difficulty level, rewarding skill and patience, which can keep you motivated while running or biking. However, the occasional long cutscenes and slower exploration parts do interrupt the pace; these moments may momentarily distract you from your workout rhythm. Nonetheless, for the most part, the combat is fluid and compelling, making it easier to maintain an exercise routine while grinding through Lords of Cinder.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

DARK SOULS III supports controller compatibility, making it a viable choice while using a treadmill or bike. The controls are straightforward, focusing on timing and strategy rather than requiring constant rapid movements or quick reflexes which would complicate your physical exertion. The game does have some intense boss fights that can lead to unexpected surprises, demanding your full attention, but overall, it allows for a manageable level of engagement, accommodating a moderate workout. Just be wary of the occasional frustrating deaths, as they may lead to off-balance treadmill antics!

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

In terms of computer requirements, DARK SOULS III is not overly demanding but does require a decent setup. A mid-range PC with at least an Intel Core i5-2500 or an AMD FX-6300, 8GB RAM, and a graphics card like NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 or AMD Radeon HD 7950 should run the game well at moderate settings. For gamers exercising and wanting to maintain a good framerate while battling it out, ensuring your rig meets or exceeds these specifications is essential, as drops in performance can lead to interruptions both in-game and in your workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

DARK SOULS III is a well-crafted experience offering both challenge and aesthetic allure. While it may not be perfect for every exercise enthusiast due to its slower sections and occasional interruptions, it does provide an engaging gameplay experience that can keep you motivated and focused, making it an excellent choice for those on a treadmill or bike. The game’s compatibility with basic controllers smooths out the experience, allowing for most players to enjoy one of the finest entries in the franchise without sacrificing their fitness goals.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
