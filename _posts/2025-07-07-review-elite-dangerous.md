Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Elite Dangerous,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Elite Dangerous Review

Elite Dangerous invites players into an expansive universe teeming with possibilities, and when you bring exercise into the mix, things get even more intriguing. As a fitness enthusiast who loves the thrill of gaming, I put this game through its paces to see how it aligns with treadmill running or biking.

# Gameplay

The sheer scale of Elite Dangerous is staggering. Set in a realistic representation of our Milky Way galaxy, the game emphasizes exploration, trade, combat, and more. Once you get past the initial learning curve, the gameplay becomes incredibly engaging. The freedom to explore is intoxicating, and each mission feels rewarding. That said, there are some slower moments, particularly during long travel times or when waiting for an NPC to show up. However, these lengthy stretches are easily mitigated if you focus on your surroundings. As long as you keep an eye on the action happening in your ship and your objectives, your run or bike session won’t feel stifled.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Elite Dangerous requires a fair amount of management as you jump from one star system to another, but it generally avoids the need for rapid reflexes. The controls are versatile—compatible with various controllers, which is a big plus. You can fine-tune your setup for comfortable accessibility, allowing you to manage your ship without excessive distractions. However, be aware that more intense dogfighting situations may divert your focus momentarily from your workout. But overall, it strikes a good balance with a non-twitch gameplay style that enables you to maintain your exercise rhythm.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Elite Dangerous is relatively demanding on computer hardware, especially at higher settings. With realistic graphics that bring the vastness of space to life, you’ll want a decent setup to truly dive into the experience without lag. For optimal performance, a solid GPU along with a shared or dedicated CPU is essential, along with sufficient RAM. If you’re using older hardware, be prepared for some graphical downgrades, which could affect your immersion level and, consequently, your motivation during workouts.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Elite Dangerous effectively combines the exploration of a vast universe with engaging enough gameplay that keeps you interested. While there are moments that may slow down your exercise routine, the overall experience is rewarding enough to make up for it. With its good compatibility for controllers, you can easily navigate your ship while maintaining your workout. Just make sure your computer can handle the graphical demands, especially if you want to enjoy it fully while getting fit.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
