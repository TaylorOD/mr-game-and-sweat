Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Resident Evil 2,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Resident Evil 2 Review

Resident Evil 2, remade in 2019 from the beloved classic, delivers an exhilarating blend of survival horror and action that keeps players engaged and on the edge of their seats. A perfect match for those looking to stay active while enjoying an intensive video game experience, let’s break it down to see how it stacks up in various categories.

## Gameplay

The core mechanics of Resident Evil 2 are truly captivating, filled with intense moments and strategic gameplay that can distract players just enough from their treadmill or bike workouts. The gameplay features a tense atmosphere infused with puzzles, monster encounters, and resource management, making it engaging throughout. While there are a few cutscenes to enjoy, they are relatively brief and not overly frequent, allowing you to maintain your pace while still being involved in the storyline. Overall, expect your heart rate to rise not just from the physical exercise but also from the jump scares and nail-biting encounters.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Resident Evil 2 excels in controller compatibility, making it a strong candidate for those who want to multitask while getting their workout in. The controls are responsive, and players can navigate the environment with ease while focusing on their exercise. However, the game does require a fair amount of aiming and precision, particularly during intense combat situations, which might demand some dexterity that could be challenging when you're in the midst of a workout. If you're running or biking at a high intensity, you might find it difficult to aim precisely or react quickly to the zombies. Nonetheless, for moderate tempo sessions, it’s quite manageable.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Resident Evil 2's remastered graphics are a sight to behold, but they do come with certain demands from your PC. While not overly harsh, it does require a respectable setup to run smoothly—at least an Intel Core i5 with 8GB of RAM and a dedicated graphics card will ensure you enjoy the stunning visuals without hiccups. If your system is on the lower end, you may need to dial down the settings, which could detract from the immersion that this atmospheric title aims to provide.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Resident Evil 2 seamlessly blends brisk gameplay perfect for keeping your heart rate up while engaging in some serious gameplay. While there are a few logistical challenges, such as needing precision during intense moments, it’s largely a fantastic companion for treadmill or biking sessions. With a strong focus on atmosphere, strategy, and thrills, this title is a must-play for fitness gamers, especially those who enjoy an adrenaline rush. 

### Overall Score: 2.3 out of 3
