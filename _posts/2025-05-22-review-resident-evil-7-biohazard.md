# Resident Evil 7 Biohazard: A Game Review with a Twist

Resident Evil 7 Biohazard brings players into the terrifying world of survival horror, and it does so with an intense and immersive experience. For those looking to keep the adrenaline pumping while they’re on the treadmill or biking, here’s my breakdown of how this game stacks up.

## Gameplay

Resident Evil 7's gameplay is a masterclass in atmosphere and immersion, seamlessly blending exploration, puzzles, and survival mechanics. The first-person perspective heightens the sense of vulnerability, and the game is filled with moments that will keep your heart racing—perfect to match the rhythm of a good run or bike ride. That said, there are slow sections and some longer cut scenes, especially when compared to the pacing in action games. While these moments are often filled with character development and tension, they can occasionally distract the player from their physical workout. Overall, the gameplay maintains a gripping engagement, but those slower intervals could interrupt the flow of your exercise routine.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Resistance and dexterity are essential components in Resident Evil 7. The game does feature controller compatibility, which is a plus since you can connect with your gaming experience while in motion. However, certain puzzles and tense sequences may require precise movements that can be tricky while on a treadmill or bike. Quick reflexes are essential, and you might find yourself fumbling a bit as you juggle your cardio workout and the intensity of a jump scare. It might not be the best fit for users who want a seamless experience while breaking a sweat.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Resident Evil 7 is not overly demanding on hardware, making it moderately accessible for most players. The recommended requirements for smooth gameplay are manageable for most mid-tier gaming setups. However, if you're looking to pair this with streaming or running additional applications (like tracking your workout stats), ensure your system can handle the load, as higher graphics settings can strain lower-end machines.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Resident Evil 7 Biohazard is an exhilarating horror experience that successfully keeps your adrenaline flowing—and that’s a significant factor for those looking to maintain a workout routine. However, it does have its moments of slow pacing and requires a certain level of focus that might detract from your exercise goals. Still, if you're able to balance your workout with the heart-pounding moments the game provides, it can be an entertaining complement to your physical endeavor. 

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
