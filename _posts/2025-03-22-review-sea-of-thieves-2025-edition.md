# Gameplay

The gameplay in "Sea of Thieves: 2025 Edition" is designed to immerse players in a loot-filled pirate fantasy. The core loop of sailing, exploring, and battling is as engaging as ever, with new quests and achievements that require exploration, teamwork, and savvy strategy. There's a healthy balance of action-packed naval battles sprinkled with quieter moments spent managing your ship or solving treasure riddles. Importantly, the game doesn’t linger excessively on cutscenes, allowing players to stay active with minimal interruptions.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

"Sea of Thieves: 2025 Edition" is optimized for controller play, making it a great fit for those on treadmills or stationary bikes. The game’s controls are designed for a relatively relaxed input style, allowing you to maintain a steady pace while steering your pirate ship or fighting off skeletal foes. While there are moments of intense combat that require quick reflexes, overall gameplay is forgiving enough for those balancing their weight with cardio. Just keep in mind that you might have to sacrifice some agility when it comes to making split-second decisions during battles—a quick sidestep on the treadmill isn’t as easy as it sounds! 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The graphics in "Sea of Thieves: 2025 Edition" have received a nice upgrade, showcasing vibrant pirate lore and breathtaking oceanic environments. However, with these enhancements comes a need for relatively robust hardware. While the minimum requirements are accessible, if you’re aiming for a smooth experience with high settings, prepare for some advanced graphics cards and a decent CPU. If you're gaming on a more powerful rig, the visuals will elevate your experience significantly, while owners of older machines may need to lower their settings—but it’s still manageable.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3
