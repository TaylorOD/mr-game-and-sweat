Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Space Engineers,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Space Engineers Review

Space Engineers offers players a sandbox experience centered around creativity, engineering, and survival in space. As you build and maintain your space stations, ships, and planetary bases, the game allows for a wealth of exploration and engineering possibilities. 

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Space Engineers is profoundly engaging for those who enjoy building and crafting. Tasks such as mining resources, constructing intricate machinery, and designing functional environments can easily fill hours of your time. However, it can occasionally divert your attention from exercising on a treadmill or bike. While the gameplay is generally fluid, there are instances where you might find yourself engrossed in solving a complex engineering problem, which could lead to long periods of inactivity. Luckily, the game is mostly devoid of slow sections or lengthy cutscenes, and players can pick up and put down activities as they please, which lets you adapt your playstyle to your exercise routine.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Space Engineers boasts solid controller compatibility, allowing you to navigate the game while staying active on your treadmill or bike. However, the game does demand some level of precision in your movements, particularly when manipulating blocks or engaging in combat, which might require brief moments of concentration and coordination. This could lead to disrupted exercise sessions if you're engaging in intense gameplay. However, the ability to pause the game at any time gives you the flexibility to break if you need to catch your breath or drink some water.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Space Engineers is moderately demanding on computer hardware. While you could run it on a mid-range gaming rig, higher graphics settings and more extensive builds would benefit from a more powerful system. This may limit the ability for some users to set up a compact exercise-and-gaming space if your setup cannot handle the game smoothly. Make sure to check the specifications beforehand to ensure your system won’t break a sweat while you’re trying to work up a sweat.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Overall, Space Engineers is an engaging title that successfully combines creativity with survival gameplay. Though it can occasionally distract you from your workout, it offers the flexibility to pause and adapt to your exercise needs. With good controller compatibility and manageable requirements for most systems, it's a solid choice for those looking to build and explore while being active. Just remember to find a balance—you don't want to miss out on your treadmill session because you're lost in space!

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
