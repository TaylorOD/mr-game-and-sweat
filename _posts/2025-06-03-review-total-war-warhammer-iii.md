Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Total War: WARHAMMER III,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Total War: WARHAMMER III

Total War: WARHAMMER III (TW:W3) invites players into a sprawling fantasy realm brimming with lush environments, strategic depth, and infamous factions from the Warhammer universe. But how does this epic title fare for players who want to keep their heart rates up while using a treadmill or bike? Let’s find out.

## Gameplay

Engaging is the name of the game, but in the case of TW:W3, the extensive turn-based strategy paired with real-time battles does a fantastic job of pulling you into its narrative. Players can expect to spend significant time planning their strategies in the campaign map before jumping into high-stakes battles. The strategic elements certainly allow for brief pauses, making it easier to balance gameplay with your workout session. However, there are moments when the lengthy siege battles and unit deployments might slow your pace down, especially when you are running on a treadmill. While there are some cutscenes, they are not overly long, and skimming through them is possible. Overall, the game keeps the adrenaline flowing, but players should still be mindful of their workout intensity during the more strategic planning phases.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

TW:W3 shines as a title that embraces a controller well, making it easier to follow the action on a treadmill or bike. Its mechanics primarily revolve around strategy and unit placement, so lunging for quick reflexes is minimal. That said, there are times where you may need to navigate a battlefield quickly, requiring you to step up your pace. With the game's reliance on strategic planning, the slower-paced segments allow you to enjoy the story and mechanics without hampering your workout technique too much. Whether you’re dialing up the resistance on a bike or kicking up the speed on the treadmill, your heart rate should remain steady as you navigate through command menus.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

On the technical side, TW:W3 demands a fair level of expertise from your PC. Running smoothly requires a mid to high-end gaming rig, featuring at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor, along with 8GB of RAM and a graphics card like the NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD RX 570. The game's stunning visuals and grand scope come at the cost of needing a decent machine, but don’t worry—if your setup meets these standards, you’ll appreciate the delightful graphics and fluid gameplay without much lag. If you're running the game while working out, just be sure your device is in a ventilated area to avoid overheating.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

All in all, Total War: WARHAMMER III provides a compelling mix of strategy and fantasy that will resonate with fans of the franchise, all while being mindful of the need to stay active. Balanced pacing and engaging gameplay allow you to enjoy your workout without compromising your gaming experience. While avid gamers may want a bit more dynamism in combat to keep up the heart rate, it's generally a solid companion for treadmill and biking enthusiasts. Get ready to strategize, but just remember to keep an eye on your workout results!

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
