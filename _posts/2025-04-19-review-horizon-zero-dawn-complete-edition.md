Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition: A Review for Gamers on the Move

Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is an ambitious action role-playing game that transports players to a breathtaking, post-apocalyptic world dominated by robotic creatures. While it’s critical to engage with the story and mechanics of the game, we’ll see how it stacks up for fitness enthusiasts looking to run or bike while gaming.

# Gameplay

Horizon Zero Dawn offers a compelling mix of exploration, combat, and a rich narrative. As Aloy, players will traverse stunning landscapes, from lush forests to arid deserts, participating in thrilling battles against mechanized beasts. The gameplay mechanics are smooth and intuitive, providing a satisfying blend of bow and arrow combat, stealth, and crafting.

However, there are instances of slow pacing, particularly during cutscenes and story exposition, which can disrupt your momentum on a treadmill or bike. While the main gameplay is gripping and encourages exploration, the occasional longer cutscene might pull you out of an active groove. That said, the action-heavy segments are truly engaging and can keep you invested, making it easier to stay on track while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with running or cycling, Horizon Zero Dawn performs reasonably well. The game allows for controller use, which means you can easily manage gameplay without needing to keyboard-mash or struggle with complex hand movements. The combat sequences rely on strategic thinking rather than quick reflexes, making it accessible for those in motion.

However, players will need to be mindful of the limited mobility that can come from being on a treadmill or bike. The steady focus on exploration might lead to tense moments when you find yourself wanting to concentrate solely on the game rather than maintaining your pace. Overall, it’s well-suited for casual sessions, but dedicated gamers may find frequent adjustments necessary.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Horizon Zero Dawn is visually stunning, but this level of detail does come with some hardware demands. To run the game smoothly, you'll need at least an Intel Core i5-2500K or AMD FX-6300 processor, along with 8 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 or AMD Radeon R9 290 graphics card. The demands might limit some casual setups, potentially throwing a wrench into your play-and-exercise plans if your hardware isn’t up to par.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is a striking game that offers an exhilarating blend of action and exploration. While it does have some pacing issues and hardware requirements that could impact gameplay, it provides a rewarding experience that can be enjoyed while exercising. With a solid balance of combat and narrative, it manages to engage players, albeit with slightly challenging compatibility for those focused on fitness.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
