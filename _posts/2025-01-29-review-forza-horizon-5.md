# Forza Horizon 5 Game Review

Forza Horizon 5 is the latest installment in the open-world racing series by Playground Games. Set against the vibrant backdrop of Mexico, it offers a thrilling experience that makes driving feel as captivating as it does exhilarating. If you’re a fitness enthusiast looking to get active while gaming, read on for how well this game fits your treadmill or bike routine.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Forza Horizon 5 is nothing short of spectacular. The open world is immensely engaging, filled with diverse environments from deserts to jungles, and the variety of vehicles at your disposal adds to the enjoyment. Races are dynamic and full of action, keeping you on your toes without unnecessary downtime. While there are occasional cutscenes, they are brief and don’t disrupt the flow of the game significantly. You’ll find the adrenaline-pumping races and casual drives to be a perfect companion to your workout, as the excitement keeps your mind engaged and your heart rate up.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Forza Horizon 5 works beautifully with treadmill and bike setups. The game primarily utilizes standard controller inputs, which are easily manageable while running or biking. It does require a bit of coordination to handle sharp turns and manual gear changes, but the overall gameplay is not reliant on quick reflexes or twitch movements that could compromise your workout. The game’s forgiving nature allows you to lean into your exercise routine while still enjoying the high-speed chases around Mexico.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side, Forza Horizon 5 is quite demanding, requiring a robust gaming rig to fully enjoy its stunning graphics and vast open world. Minimum requirements ask for an AMD or Intel processor paired with at least an NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD RX 0500-series graphics card, alongside a recommended RAM of 8GB or more. While a lower spec computer can still run the game, it may risk lagging during high-octane races which could flow into your treadmill or biking gameplay for an altogether less immersive experience.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Forza Horizon 5 presents an infectiously fun racing experience that complements an active lifestyle remarkably well. Its engaging gameplay can easily distract you from the workout you’re doing, making those treadmill or biking sessions feel less like a chore. Moreover, the controller compatibility ensures that a solid workout doesn’t mean you compromise on your gaming enjoyment. Just be mindful of your computer's specifications to optimize your experience. Overall, Forza Horizon 5 checks all the right boxes for gamers who love to stay active.

### Overall Score: 2.67 out of 3
