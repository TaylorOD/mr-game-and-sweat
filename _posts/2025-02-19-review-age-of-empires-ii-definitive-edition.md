# Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Review

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is a classic real-time strategy game that has been lovingly remastered for modern audiences. With its intricate mechanics, historical settings, and engaging gameplay, it is a labor of love and nostalgia. But how does it stack up for users looking to get their exercise in while engaging in epic battles and expanding their empires? Let's break it down.

## Gameplay

As a real-time strategy game, Age of Empires II requires players to construct buildings, manage resources, and command units in combat. The pacing is generally swift, compelling players to stay focused and engaged with their strategies, which can definitely help to keep the treadmill running at a smooth rate. The game features a variety of modes, including campaigns, skirmishes, and online multiplayer, and is largely free from long cut scenes and slow sections, making it relatively easy to maintain momentum while moving.

For those exercising, it's rewarding to create strategies on-the-fly with little interruption—perfect for a quick glance at your screen between strides. The diversity in gameplay makes it engaging enough to hold your attention, though the focus required sometimes pulls at your mental energy if you're really pushing yourself on a bike or treadmill.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition performs well in a fitness-focused setting. The game is traditionally controlled through a mouse and keyboard setup, but it does have controller compatibility, making it easier to manage your movements while staying mobile. However, the game does require some quick decision-making and movements—this is not a passive game where you can just enjoy the scenery while you pedal.

Despite this, the overall pace of the game and structure allow for short breaks where you can catch your breath during resource gathering or unit building, making it more forgiving than other fast-paced shooters or action games.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

In terms of the technical demands, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is quite forgiving. It runs smoothly on a wide range of systems and doesn’t require top-tier hardware. You can run it comfortably on computers with moderate specs, making it accessible to most players. This lower demand allows you to focus more on your game and less on the specs of your system—great news for anyone trying to squeeze in some quick exercise sessions!

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition is a worthy addition to any gamer's library, especially for those who wish to combine their love for strategy games with their fitness routines. With engaging gameplay that keeps you involved but allows for breaks, compatibility with various control schemes, and reasonable computer requirements, it strikes a good balance for playing while exercising. While it has minor drawbacks in the necessity for strategic focus during intense moments, the overall experience makes it a great fit for the treadmill or bike.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
