# Borderlands 2: Review for Fitness Gamers

Borderlands 2 is an iconic first-person shooter that combines an engaging open-world experience with a unique art style and unforgettable characters. But as a fitness gamer, how does it stand up for those looking to keep their heart rates up while blasting through Bandit-infested wastelands? 

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Borderlands 2 is highly engaging, filled with a mix of exploration, combat, and quest-solving that keeps you on your toes. The vast variety of quests and missions means there's always something to focus on, helping to distract you from the treadmill or bike beneath you. There are moments when intense gunfights and boss encounters can lead to quick reflex decisions, but these are always balanced with moments of exploration and puzzle-solving that prevent any dull sections. While there are plenty of engaging cutscenes between missions, they typically don’t last too long, allowing you to jump right back into action between running or cycling sessions. It's the ideal game to keep your mind engaged while maintaining a solid workout pace!

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Borderlands 2 has excellent compatibility with both treadmills and bikes due to its controller-friendly gameplay structure. You don't need rapid-fire buttons or complex combos; instead, you can seamlessly control the character with a gamepad while focusing on your movement. The game's nature requires a mix of aiming and movement rather than twitch-based reflexes, making it manageable to play while engaged in steady cardio. However, players should be aware that during certain high-intensity battles, you may need to adjust your intensity if you're focusing on precision shooting while also trying to keep up your pace.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

On the technical side, Borderlands 2 is fairly forgiving when it comes to computer requirements. The game is known for its art style, which allows it to run on lower-end systems without much compromise on visual fidelity. For most average gaming PCs, you're looking at around an Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent processor, with at least 2GB of RAM and a dedicated video card (like NVIDIA GeForce 8500 or ATI Radeon HD 2600). This means you likely won’t have to invest heavily in hardware to enjoy a good gaming session while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Borderlands 2 is an outstanding choice for fitness gamers. Its engaging gameplay will keep you distracted from your workout routine, making it easier to power through those last few minutes on the treadmill or bike. While it has some minor downsides in terms of intense combat situations, it generally allows for a flow of relaxed gameplay suitable for cardio. The computer requirements are also accessible enough for most gamers, so you won't need to upgrade your setup just for this title.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
