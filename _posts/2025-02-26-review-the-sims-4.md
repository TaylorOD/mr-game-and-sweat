The Sims franchise has long been a staple in the world of life simulation games, and "The Sims 4" continues that legacy with new features and an unparalleled level of customization. This review will explore how well the game holds up while exercising on a treadmill or biking, so players can optimize their fitness goals without skipping a beat on their gaming experience.

## Gameplay

"The Sims 4" is a highly engaging game that thrives on creativity and freedom. Players create and manage their Sims, guiding them through various life stages, careers, relationships, and aspirations. The open-ended nature of the game allows for numerous paths and storylines that can captivate your attention for hours. Importantly, the game is structured in a way that doesn't overwhelm you with fast-paced action or lengthy cut scenes. Although certain gameplay loops may feel repetitive after extended playtime, they're broken up by the myriad of activities available for your Sims to engage in.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with exercise equipment, "The Sims 4" shines once again. The game is playable with a standard controller, which is great news for those exercising while gaming. Its leisurely pace means that you won't need to perform sudden reflex movements or take your attention away from your workout to juggle complex commands. The intuitive interface allows you to manage your Sims seamlessly, allowing you to focus on forms of exercise that require both concentration and movement, such as walking or biking. 

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

While "The Sims 4" can be graphically demanding, it isn't excessively so, making it accessible for a wide range of systems. Minimum requirements include an Intel Core i3 or equivalent processor and 4GB of RAM, while recommended specs push it a bit further with an i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. Most modern gaming setups should handle "The Sims 4" smoothly, even while multitasking with music or workout apps in the background. However, graphics settings can be adjusted for those on lower-end hardware, ensuring that performance remains stable even during intensive gameplay sessions.
