# TEKKEN 7 Game Review

TEKKEN 7 is a beloved fighting game that appeals to both hardcore and casual gamers alike. With its flashy graphics, deep mechanics, and an expansive roster of characters, it has cemented its spot as a staple in the fighting game community. But how does it hold up for those who want to get their cardio in while enjoying some bouts of martial arts mayhem? Let’s dive in!

# Gameplay

The gameplay in TEKKEN 7 is engaging and skillful, featuring a rich combat system that blends accessibility for new players with layered mechanics for veterans. Matches are fast-paced, and the ability to pull off combos and signature moves keeps players glued to their screens. However, the game does have its slower moments during character introductions and certain special moves, which could momentarily break the pace while on a treadmill or bike. Thankfully, the majority of matches are action-packed, ensuring that you remain distracted from the monotony of exercise.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to treadmill and bike compatibility, TEKKEN 7 performs reasonably well. The game is compatible with traditional controllers, allowing for a more relaxed play style, which is crucial when you’re trying to maintain a steady running or biking pace. However, the precise timing required for executing combos and counter moves can potentially lead to some frustrating moments, especially if you’re trying to balance your physical activity with quick reflexes. It’s not as demanding as some twitch-heavy shooters, but it does require a bit of focus.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

TEKKEN 7 is not the most demanding game in terms of computer hardware. The recommended specifications allow it to run smoothly on mid-range systems, making it accessible to a wider audience. However, for those pushing their graphics settings to the max in order to get the best visuals during their gaming sessions, a beefier setup is required. While it won't require top-of-the-line specs, having decent hardware will absolutely enhance your gameplay experience, which is especially important if you're trying to keep your focus off the tread.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

TEKKEN 7 delivers an engaging fighting experience with quick-paced action that can perk up your treadmill or biking workout, though it has some moments that may disrupt your flow. Its controller compatibility is a plus, making it feasible to play while exercising, while the game's accessible requirements mean you won’t need a high-end rig to enjoy it. Ultimately, while it's not the perfect game for sticking to your exercise routine, it certainly adds an exciting layer to your cardio regimen.
