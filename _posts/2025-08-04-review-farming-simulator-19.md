# Farming Simulator 19 Game Review

Farming Simulator 19 invites players to step into the shoes of a modern-day farmer, offering an immersive experience filled with crops, livestock, and expansive land to cultivate. But how does this ambitious farming simulation adapt to the active lifestyle, especially when combined with exercising on a treadmill or bike? Let’s break it down.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Farming Simulator 19 is incredibly engaging, with a wealth of activities that can occupy your attention for hours. Players can plant and harvest crops, raise animals, and manage their farms while zooming in on the intricate details of machinery and equipment. The open-world nature encourages exploration and allows you to test out different styles of play—ranging from casual farming to hardcore management.

However, the game does present slow sections, especially during the planting and harvesting phases when you’re waiting for crops to grow. Thankfully, these moments are often punctuated by the satisfaction of watching your farm flourish, which can keep you motivated. There aren’t many cut scenes, and the game keeps you actively engaged. You can easily manage your farm while giving your legs a nice workout on the treadmill, making it a solid companion for your exercise routine.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Farming Simulator 19 shines in terms of compatibility with exercise equipment. The game supports controller play, allowing for a more comfortable experience while you’re moving. The controls are primarily focused on steering and occasional button presses, making it easier to maintain your pace while managing your crops.

Since the gameplay mechanics do not require quick reflexes or twitch-based movements, you can play the game at your own pace without compromising your workout. You can focus on controlling your character and equipment without worrying about fast-paced action, making it entirely suitable for those hopping on a treadmill or bike.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Farming Simulator 19 is moderately demanding in terms of computer specifications. While it runs well on mid-range systems, higher graphics settings can be taxing, especially if you want to enjoy the stunning rural vistas. Minimum requirements include an Intel Core i3 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 graphics card, and at least 8GB of RAM to run smoothly.

Players with high-end systems will find they can enjoy enhanced graphics, which can make the experience even more captivating while exercising; however, those on older machines may experience lag or longer load times, which can be distracting during a workout. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Farming Simulator 19 presents a captivating farming experience that balances well with an active lifestyle. Its engaging gameplay provides an enthralling distraction while exercising, and its compatibility with controllers makes it easy to integrate into your routine. While there are some slow elements, they mainly contribute to the farming simulation's charm rather than detract from the overall experience. The computer requirements are manageable, but players should be aware of potential performance hiccups based on their hardware.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
