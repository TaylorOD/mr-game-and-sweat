# Outlast Trials Review

The Outlast Trials marks a fresh entry into the horror genre, combining psychological thriller elements with cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Set during the Cold War, players find themselves trapped in a sinister experiment, pitted against terrifying foes in a truly harrowing environment. But how does this game fare when it comes to keeping you engaged during your treadmill or biking routine?

# Gameplay

The gameplay in The Outlast Trials is edge-of-your-seat thrilling, as it encourages seamless cooperation among players while navigating through twisted environments and evading terrifying threats. Unlike traditional horror games that lull you into long cut-scene breaks or slow sections, Trials keeps the tension high and the pacing brisk. The need to strategize with your teammates while keeping an eye out for lurking dangers draws you in, ensuring you're engaged and less likely to notice the time or the intensity of your workout. The game offers plenty of excitement as you sprint, crouch, and crawl through environments, which keeps your heart rate up—perfect for those treadmill or stationary bike sessions.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Outlast Trials works surprisingly well with treadmills and bikes, though it requires you to adjust your physical movement style. The game supports controller inputs, enabling smooth navigation while remaining focused on your workout. However, the gameplay is heavily reliant on stealth and spatial awareness rather than quick reflexes, which is great news for us fitness gamers! You can immerse yourself in the psychological tension while maintaining a decent pace on your equipment. Just remember that the closer you get to the enemies, the more adrenaline you’ll feel—so strap in, and be prepared for your heart rate to soar!

While Outlast Trials is an engaging title, it demands a reasonable amount of processing power. The graphics are impressive, with disturbing visuals that enhance the atmosphere. While you won’t need the latest gaming rig, ensure that your setup meets the recommended requirements to avoid lag or performance dips, which could detract from the immersive experience. If you’re gearing up for an exercise session, having a stable system that can handle the game’s demands will definitively enhance the gameplay without interruptions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3
