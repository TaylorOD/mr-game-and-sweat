Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Planet Zoo,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Planet Zoo Review

Planet Zoo is a beautifully crafted simulation game developed by Frontier Developments that allows players to create and manage their own zoo while focusing on animal welfare, conservation, and guest satisfaction. As someone who enjoys both gaming and exercise, I’ve put this game to the test while on the treadmill, and here’s how it fared.

# Gameplay

In Planet Zoo, gameplay revolves around designing and building an intricate zoo from the ground up. Players will engage in a mix of constructing habitats, managing animal welfare, and catering to the needs of guests. The game is engaging and provides a wealth of options that can easily draw you in; the depth is impressive, allowing customization to an incredible degree. You can spend hours meticulously planning out pathways, habitats, and landscaping.

Fortunately, the pacing of the game keeps the distraction at bay. While there are a few slow moments while arranging your zoo or checking animal needs, cutscenes are minimal, allowing for a consistent flow of play that can easily accompany moderate exercise. However, there can be periods of micromanagement that might require a bit of focus, which could compete for your attention if you’re trying to run at the same time.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Planet Zoo performs well when it comes to compatibility with exercise equipment like treadmills or bikes, particularly because it supports controller input. This means you can comfortably maneuver around your zoo without being glued to your keyboard and mouse. However, the game does involve some intricate management that may necessitate quick adjustments or a focused eye on certain design aspects, which can prove challenging if you’re bouncing around on a treadmill.

That said, most actions are manageable, allowing players to shift their focus back and forth from the gameplay to the physical workout. I found that maintaining moderate speed while engaging with the game was possible, especially during the more laid-back planning and building phases.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Planet Zoo requires a reasonably robust computer to run smoothly. It calls for a minimum of an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 or AMD Radeon RX 470 graphics card. While the visual experience of the game is rich and detailed, it can lead to performance hiccups on lower-end systems, especially as your zoo grows larger and more complex. Building a massive zoo could push your system, which may not be ideal for those squeezing a workout in during gameplay.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Planet Zoo ultimately shines as an engaging and visually stunning simulation that offers a satisfying experience, especially if you enjoy exercising while gaming. With its moderately paced gameplay, controller compatibility, and detailed requirements, it manages to strike a balance between providing a fun and rewarding experience while allowing you to keep active. Just be prepared for the occasional challenge if your computer struggles to keep up.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
