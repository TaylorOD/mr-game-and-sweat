## Gameplay

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Splitgate offers excellent compatibility when it comes to treadmill or bike gaming setups. The game is designed to be played with a controller, which allows for a more comfortable setup compared to games that require precise mouse movements. However, the fast-paced nature of Splitgate does require good reflexes and quick reactions. Players need to be proficient in managing their portal placements while simultaneously engaging in combat. While this could lead to some difficulties if you're trying to maintain a steady pace on a treadmill, the overall enjoyment makes it worth the challenge.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Splitgate is relatively accessible when it comes to computer requirements. It doesn't demand top-of-the-line hardware, meaning you can play without needing an ultra-high-end gaming rig. Minimum specs are modest, but if you're aiming for smooth performance and competitive play, a decent mid-range PC is recommended. This accessibility makes it a good choice for players who are also looking to fit gaming into their exercise regimen without hefty investments in hardware.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Splitgate: Arena Warfare provides an exhilarating experience that encourages physical engagement and keeps your heart racing, making it an excellent choice for those looking to integrate gaming with exercise. Its fast-paced gameplay, while a challenge on a treadmill or bike, ensures that your workout is anything but boring. Computer accessibility further enhances its appeal, allowing a broader range of players to dive into the action.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
