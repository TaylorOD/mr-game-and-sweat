# Gameplay

In **The Forest**, players find themselves stranded on a mysterious island after a plane crash.

The experience is quite engaging as you gather supplies and craft tools, immersing you in a cycle of constant action and survival strategies. The game strikes a balance between exploration, crafting, and combat, keeping your heart rate up without excessive slow sections or lengthy cutscenes.

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike, **The Forest** offers a positive experience. The game supports standard controllers, which means you can comfortably play without the need for intense finger gymnastics. The gameplay mechanics do not require twitch reactions, allowing you to maintain a steady pace. However, the occasional need to run or dodge can be challenging while maintaining your workout intensity, but it's manageable. Plus, the intermittent pauses during building will allow you to take a breather between more frantic moments, making it a good fit for exercise.

You can run it smoothly with an NVIDIA GTX 660 or equivalent, along with a reasonable amount of RAM. While the graphics are stunning, they don’t demand the latest hardware, meaning you won't find your computer slowing down significantly—important if you’re also multitasking with exercise. Overall, it's easy on the hardware and doesn't interfere with your workout routine.
