Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

## Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Review

*Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* has returned to immerse players in its historically rich world, and it brings some intriguing mechanics to the table that can enhance your treadmill or biking sessions. But how does it stack up for exercise enthusiasts? Let’s dig in.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* continues the franchise's commitment to realism and immersion. The expansive open world is filled with quests and adventures that keep you engaged. However, there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly, particularly during some lengthy cutscenes and dialogue sequences. While exploring the lush environment or engaging in action-packed combat can be exhilarating, downtime can lead you to zone out – which can be counterproductive when trying to maintain focus on your workout. The good news is that there are plenty of engaging missions that can keep your adrenaline up, especially during intense combat sequences.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike, *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* fares quite well. The game supports controllers, allowing players to maintain a steady rhythm while running or biking. Most of the gameplay can be managed with less frantic movements, meaning you won’t have to deal with quick reflex challenges that could cause you to stumble mid-run. The ability to engage with the world at your own pace makes it a suitable title for exercise, provided you don’t mind a few stretches of inactivity during dialogue-heavy segments.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side of things, *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* holds onto its predecessor’s demanding performance standards. You’ll need a robust setup to enjoy the best visual experience, with recommended specs suggesting a solid mid-to-high range GPU and a decent amount of RAM. If you’re playing on a lower-end system, you may experience frame dips that could distract from your exercise session. Ensuring that your hardware is up to the task will allow for a smoother experience whether you’re engrossed in the game world or trying to keep that heart rate up.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

*Kingdom Come: Deliverance II* provides a balanced experience while also catering well to those looking to combine gaming with exercise. Its engaging gameplay and adequate compatibility with treadmill and bike setups make it an excellent choice, though the occasional slow moments can disrupt the flow. If you have the hardware to support it, you'll find this title classically rewarding as you explore its vast world – just be wary of those long cutscenes during your workout!

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
