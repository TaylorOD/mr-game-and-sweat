Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Just Cause 3,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Game Review: Just Cause 3

Just Cause 3 is a wild, chaotic adventure that invites players to unleash their inner daredevil on the beautiful Mediterranean island of Medici. Known for its over-the-top physics and action-packed gameplay, this installment in the beloved franchise continues to push the boundaries of what an open-world game can offer. But how does it fare for those looking to get a workout while gaming? Let’s dive in!

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Just Cause 3 is nothing short of electrifying. It places players into Rico Rodriguez’s boots as he embarks on a mission to liberate his homeland from a tyrannical dictator. The game is overflowing with explosive action, vast environments, and a remarkable freedom to wreak havoc however you choose. Engaging with the stunning visuals and vibrant landscapes will undoubtedly keep your attention, ensuring you don't get bored while exercising. 

However, the thrill is somewhat diluted by a few longer missions and some repetitive objectives. While cutting-edge chaos unfolds around you, there are quiet moments that may lead you to lose focus on your treadmill run or bike pedal. Particularly, some dialogue-heavy sequences can disturb the rhythm of your session, but they are relatively infrequent. Overall, the balance between relentless action and calmer moments makes it fairly engaging for those looking to keep moving.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

In terms of compatibility with a treadmill or bike, Just Cause 3 offers a decent experience. You can easily play with a game controller, allowing you to adjust your grip and maintain your stride or pedal without the need for intense hand-eye coordination. The game's overall controls are simple enough, meaning you won’t need to make rapid fire, twitch gameplay movements that can upset your workout. That said, navigating the sprawling environment may require managing multiple keys or buttons, but this can be handled smoothly without compromising your workout pace.

However, be mindful that some stunts may have you shifting focus away from your workout momentarily; so it's best suited for those who can multitask effectively while keeping an eye on their fitness goals.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical front, Just Cause 3 requires a decent setup to run smoothly. The minimum system requirements are relatively accessible, with a mid-range processor and graphics card needed to enjoy the vibrant and chaotic visuals. However, for optimal performance and true immersion, a higher-end setup is recommended. Players should ensure that their systems meet or exceed the recommended specifications, which include a powerful CPU and GPU along with sufficient memory and storage. If you're looking to game while exercising, having a reliable setup that runs seamlessly can prevent frustrating downtime and interruptions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 offers a thrilling gaming experience filled with chaos and explosive fun, which can fit well into an exercise routine — provided you can maintain focus through some quieter moments. While the treadmill or bike compatibility is decent, players should be cautious about how those moments may impact overall engagement in your workout. Technology-wise, ensure your computer can handle the demands of this action-packed title to maximize enjoyment without interruptions.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
