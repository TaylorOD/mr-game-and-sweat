# Gameplay

# A Plague Tale: Innocence - Game Review

A Plague Tale: Innocence is a harrowing journey through medieval France, enveloped in the dark taint of the Black Death. Developed by Asobo Studio, this title combines stealth, puzzle-solving, and narrative-driven gameplay with an emotional soundtrack and stunning visuals. However, how does it fare for those looking to combine their gaming experience with a solid workout on a treadmill or bike? Let's break it down.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in A Plague Tale: Innocence revolves around Amicia and her younger brother, Hugo, as they navigate a world filled with danger and despair. Players are tasked with sneaking past enemies, solving environmental puzzles, and managing resources to survive. The narrative is compelling and keeps players engaged throughout, but be warned: there are a number of slow sections and lengthy cut scenes. While these immersive moments help delve into the rich story, they can break the flow of your workout, making you more inclined to ease up on that treadmill or bike. Ultimately, the gameplay remains engaging, but pace-wise, it does have sections that might compel you to hop off your machine during cutscenes.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with treadmills and bikes, A Plague Tale: Innocence does a decent job. The game employs controller support, making it easier to control your character while maintaining balance. However, it requires a decent amount of focused, slower-paced gameplay, particularly when sneaking around guards or solving puzzles, which can lead to a tendency to temporarily stop your workout. While it’s not filled with frantic actions demanding quick reflexes, the reflective moments might encourage those looking to push themselves to ease down a notch, making it less ideal for a high-intensity session but suitable for lighter workouts.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side, A Plague Tale: Innocence is fairly demanding, boasting impressive graphics and complex AI systems. Those who wish to run the game at high settings will need a decent graphics card and a good amount of RAM, making it potentially a little labor-intensive on lower-end systems, especially during intense scenes where both the environment and hordes of rats are rendered. Make sure your setup meets the recommended requirements to ensure a smooth and immersive experience.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, A Plague Tale: Innocence offers an emotionally charged narrative experience that can be engaging while exercising, but its slower, contemplative pace may lead you to occasionally disengage from your physical workout. Not the best choice for a high-intensity session, but it can work for lighter exercises where you want an engaging story alongside. Overall, it’s a solid title that can coexist with your treadmill or biking routine, provided you adjust your expectations accordingly.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
