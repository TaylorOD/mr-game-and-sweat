# Game Review: Dota Underlords

Dota Underlords is a strategic auto-battler that brings the rich world of Dota 2 to a new arena of gameplay. The objective is to build an unstoppable team of heroes and outsmart opponents in an engaging turn-based battle. What sets Underlords apart is its ability to cause excitement through strategic planning while also allowing players to step away briefly while their champions do the fighting, making it a great game for players who want to exercise while gaming.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Dota Underlords is captivatingly engaging. Each match's strategic depth keeps you immersed, and the unique character abilities and synergies can lead to exciting moments of victory or defeat. This ongoing cerebral engagement does not distract you from the critical task at hand—running or biking. The game flows well, with no long cut scenes or protracted downtimes, allowing you to maintain your momentum on the treadmill or bike. The action is fast-paced but measured, giving you the chance to reconfigure your team during the round intervals without feeling overwhelmed.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Dota Underlords is designed with an interface that supports controller input, which is a plus for players who prefer to remain mobile on a treadmill or bike. You can easily navigate menus and make strategic decisions with minimal necessary movement, making it feasible to keep your workout intense. The game does not require rapid-fire reflexes common in twitch-based gameplay, so players can maintain their focus on exercising while engaging with the game. The only downside is that the intensity of thinking and strategizing might occasionally detract from your physical effort if you let yourself get too engrossed.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Dota Underlords isn’t overly demanding, which is excellent news for gamers looking to run the game while working out. It can run on a relatively modest machine, with minimum requirements that won’t stress your system. This means you can enjoy a smooth gaming experience without sacrificing performance during those intense exercise sessions. 

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Dota Underlords offers an engaging gameplay experience that pairs well with workouts on a treadmill or bike. The game’s strategic elements promote a thoughtful approach to gaming that can fit into your exercise routine, while the manageable requirements for a computer facilitate accessibility. While focused gaming can sometimes pull you away from the workout, it's a small price to pay for such a deeply rewarding experience.

### Overall Score: 2.67 out of 3
