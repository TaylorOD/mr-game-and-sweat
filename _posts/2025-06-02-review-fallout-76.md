Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Fallout 76,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Fallout 76 Review

Bethesda's Fallout 76 takes a bold step into the online multiplayer world of the beloved Fallout series, but does it hold up under the pace of a treadmill or stationary bike? Let's dive into the details to see if this post-apocalyptic adventure works for your exercise routine.

## Gameplay 

Fallout 76 drops players into the vast, desolate—yet stunning—landscape of West Virginia, with the goal of rebuilding society after a nuclear disaster. The gameplay is an open-world exploration filled with quests, crafting, and the ever-present risk of mutated monsters and PvP encounters. 

One strong point is the freedom it offers; you can explore at your own pace, which is fantastic for those on a treadmill or bike. However, the game does have its slow moments. Occasional long loading screens and some drawn-out quests can disrupt your rhythm and focus on exercise. If you're the type who enjoys continuous movement, be mindful—the slower-paced quests may cause you to lose your exercise momentum.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with exercise gear, Fallout 76 holds up quite well. The game features controller compatibility, so you can easily move around while juggling running or pedaling. The combat, while requiring some agility, doesn't lead to frenetic twitch gameplay, which is beneficial for maintaining a steady workout pace. 

However, some encounters do require quick reflexes, so you're likely to break a sweat if you find yourself in a surprise battle. The good news is that because the world is vast and exploration is encouraged, there are ample opportunities for low-intensity periods where you can catch your breath.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Fallout 76 demands a fairly robust setup, which is something to consider if you're planning to run or bike while playing. The minimum requirements call for an Intel Core i5 processor and a GTX 550 or equivalent graphics card. However, for a smooth experience, especially in the often-crowded online world, an upgrade to at least an i7 CPU and GTX 780 is recommended. 

Make sure your gaming setup is not only robust but also well-ventilated to avoid overheating during those extended sessions, especially while you're moving.

### Category Score: 1 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score 

In conclusion, Fallout 76 offers a thrilling, albeit sometimes cumbersome, journey through a richly developed world that encourages exploration and survival. It shines in its compatibility with exercise setups, allowing players to enjoy a successful workout with a captivating storyline. Yet, it does present potential slow moments that might test your endurance and concentration on the treadmill or bike. 

Overall, if you enjoy a good RPG and want to combine it with your workout, Fallout 76 is definitely a worthy pick, but be prepared for some bumps along the way.

### Overall Score: 1.67 out of 3
