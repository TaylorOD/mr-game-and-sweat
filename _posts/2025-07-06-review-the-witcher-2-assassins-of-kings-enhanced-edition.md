# Review: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a remarkable RPG that draws players into its richly crafted world, featuring intricate narratives and morally complex decisions. As you engage in this fantasy epic, let’s see how it holds up for those of you who want to stay active on the treadmill or bike while gaming.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in The Witcher 2 is engrossing, offering players a blend of action, exploration, and deep storytelling. You'll find yourself lost in the sprawling landscapes and charged combat sequences, which can serve as a healthy distraction from your workout routine. Fortunately, while there are some cutscenes, the pacing of the action generally keeps the blood pumping. The tactical combat can demand attention, but with the right workout pace, this can coexist with your exercise regimen. Keep in mind, some slower sections may require you to focus, which could lead to distractions when you need to remain focused on your workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with treadmills and stationary bikes, The Witcher 2 performs admirably. The game supports standard controller configurations, allowing you to keep your hands free while you engage with the storyline or when combat breaks out. However, the game’s nature requires some finesse and timing in combat, which could become tricky if your workout is more intense. Light jogs or gentle biking will allow you to immerse in the gameplay while maintaining a decent pace, whereas intense sprints may lead to struggles during action sequences.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The Witcher 2 is fairly demanding yet, for its time, reasonable in system requirements. It runs smoothly on mid-range rigs, but to really enjoy its graphics, consider a computer that surpasses the baseline specifications. If you're streaming or multitasking while riding the bike or running on the treadmill, keep in mind that the game can strain less powerful setups. A stable and capable system will make your experience all the more enjoyable, ensuring minimal interruption as you tackle both quests and your fitness goals.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a compelling choice for anyone who loves to immerse themselves in captivating stories while staying active. Although the game has some slower moments that might pull focus, its engaging gameplay largely compensates for this. With good compatibility for controllers and a reasonable demand on PCs, it strikes a wholesome balance between leisure and physical activity. 

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
