# Age of Empires II (Retired) Review

Age of Empires II is a classic real-time strategy game that has stood the test of time, even with its retired status. With its blend of resource management, empire building, and tactical combat, it has captivated gamers since its original release in 1999. But how does it stack up for those looking to stay active while gaming on a treadmill or bike?

## Gameplay

The gameplay of Age of Empires II is incredibly engaging, pulling players into a rich world of strategy where they create and develop their civilizations. The mix of resource gathering, building, and combat keeps the players constantly occupied. You'll find yourself strategizing to perfect your city layout while managing your economy, which is an excellent way to stay engaged while exercising. 

However, the game does have its slower sections, such as extended periods of resource gathering or preparation for battles. Although these moments allow for some breath-catching and slight adjustments on a treadmill or bike, they might also pose a distraction if you're not careful. The game does lack long cutscenes, which is a blessing for those seeking to maintain their exercise intensity. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with exercise equipment, Age of Empires II offers a rather favorable experience. Its gameplay doesn't require rapid, twitch-based movements, allowing players to maintain a steady pace on a treadmill or bike without worrying about missing critical gameplay moments. The game is fully compatible with various controllers, so you can easily adjust your setup to fit your exercise routine.

That said, some of the more intricate strategies might require occasional focus and two-handed control, which could pull your attention slightly away from maintaining your workout pace. Overall, it’s manageable, but be prepared for brief dips in focus as you coordinate your empire’s actions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Despite its age, Age of Empires II doesn't demand a robust setup. Its requirements are quite modest, meaning you won’t need a top-of-the-line gaming rig to enjoy it. Players can run the game smoothly on very basic hardware, which is a significant plus for gamers who are also using older systems or are budget-conscious. This accessibility means you can easily play while engaging in light to moderate exercise. 

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Age of Empires II remains a fantastic option for those looking to combine gaming with exercise. Its engaging gameplay keeps you absorbed, and its requirements are minimal, ensuring you won't struggle to enjoy the game while maintaining an active lifestyle. While some slower sections might pose a slight challenge for focus during an intense workout, the overall experience warrants a solid thumbs-up. 

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
