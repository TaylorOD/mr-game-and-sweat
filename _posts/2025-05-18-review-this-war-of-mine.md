# This War of Mine - Game Review

This War of Mine provides a unique and poignant experience as it places you in the shoes of civilians trying to survive in a war-torn city. The focus is on the daily struggles of survival, making for a game that is both thought-provoking and immersive.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in This War of Mine is engaging and emphasizes resource management, exploration, and moral decision-making. Players must scavenge for food, medicine, and shelter while keeping their characters emotionally stable. The game's day-night cycle creates a compelling rhythm; during the day, players must stay hidden, and at night, they can venture out for supplies. The tension of balancing survival with the emotional well-being of your characters keeps you hooked. While there are no long cut scenes, some slow moments can arise during resource gathering or character interactions, which may distract you from your running session. However, the ongoing challenges keep the gameplay dynamic enough to maintain your focus.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

This War of Mine is quite compatible with treadmill or bike setup. It can be played with standard controllers, allowing you to remain steady while running or biking. The game lacks fast-paced action or time-sensitive quick movements, making it easier to focus on your workout routine. The slower pace allows you to enjoy the game while maintaining your exercise flow. Just be mindful of your surroundings when moving from one location to another in the game, as it requires you to make decisions that can influence your characters' safety.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

This War of Mine isn't particularly demanding and can run on modest hardware configurations. It requires a Windows XP or later, along with 2GB RAM and a processor that’s at least 2.0 GHz. It isn't graphically intense, so even if you are using a laptop on your treadmill, you should be able to run it without issues. This makes it accessible for a broad audience, allowing you to focus on exercising rather than worrying about your system's capabilities.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, This War of Mine offers a compelling survival experience that works well alongside your exercise routine.
