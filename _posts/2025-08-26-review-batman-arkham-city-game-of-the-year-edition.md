When it comes to treadmill and bike compatibility, Arkham City shines. The game can be played with a standard game controller, which is a must for exercising while gaming—allowing for easy setup and fluid control.

This quality ensures that you can maintain a steady pace on your treadmill or bike without needing to make frantic movements. The controls are smooth enough to allow for alternating between actions without causing you to lose focus on your workout. Additionally, the engaging narrative keeps your mind captivated, which can help pass the time on longer runs or cycling sessions.
