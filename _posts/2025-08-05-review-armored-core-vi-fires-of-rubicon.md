# Game Review: ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON

Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon marks a triumphant return to the mech combat genre, aiming to engage players with high-octane action and deep mechanical customization. But how does it stack up for those of us who like to break a sweat while gaming?

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Armored Core VI is beautifully crafted, providing a seamless blend of fast-paced mech combat and strategic planning. Players engage in intense battles, where the thrill of dodging and weaving through enemy fire keeps you on your toes. The game thrives on its dynamic combat sequences and rewarding customization options, allowing you to mold your mech to fit various play styles.

However, the game is not entirely free from slower sections. While there are certainly cutscenes that add narrative depth, they are relatively short and infrequent, ensuring that you’re mostly engaged in action. Overall, it manages to maintain a brisk pace that should help to keep your heart rate elevated, making it a fantastic companion for treadmill running or biking sessions.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Armored Core VI offers full controller compatibility, making it easy to use while on a treadmill or bike. However, the game does feature moments that demand quick reflexes and responsive movements, particularly during intense battles where you decide your mech’s positioning. While it’s straightforward enough to control from a stationary position, those sudden jerks needed for dodging might not be ideal for some.

If you’re accustomed to multitasking and have trained your sense of balance while keeping your focus on in-game actions, you might find this game to be a good match. Still, you may want to keep your treadmill at a moderate pace to avoid losing concentration.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Armored Core VI is relatively demanding, pushing the envelope on graphics and physics while delivering a visually stunning experience. Players will need a capable rig to run the game smoothly, with recommended specs including an NVIDIA GTX 1070 or AMD equivalent, alongside a decent amount of RAM and CPU power. The game’s requirement to render vast battlefields and intricate mech customization can lead to significant strain on lower-end machines.

This may not be a significant barrier for most gamers, as the genre typically attracts players with decent setups already, but it is something to keep in mind if you’re gaming on a laptop or an older system.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Overall, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon is a thrilling addition to the series that does well in providing consistent engagement while allowing for some flexibility in your exercise routine. It excels in gameplay and maintains a reasonable compatibility with fitness practices; however, its quick-reflex requirements and elevated hardware need should be carefully considered if you're trying to keep your gaming sessions integrated with your workouts. 

### Overall Score: 2.2 out of 3
