# Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) 40th Anniversary Edition Review

Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) has taken the gaming world by storm, and with its 40th Anniversary Edition, it promises even more breathtaking adventures in the skies. For those looking to combine gaming with fitness routines like running on a treadmill or biking, let’s see how well it fits into your workout regime.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Microsoft Flight Simulator is nothing short of spectacular. The realism in flight controls and the stunning graphics of landmarks and landscapes from around the world create an immersive experience. The game manages to keep your attention with its varied missions and challenges, such as landing at diverse airports or navigating through different weather conditions. Although there are moments of slower-paced flying, particularly during long flights, the exquisite environment and potential for various in-game challenges keep the engagement level high.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Microsoft Flight Simulator is primarily designed for standard game controllers, which can be a boon for exercise enthusiasts. The controls can be effectively managed using a joystick or gamepad, allowing you to engage with the game without requiring split-second reflexes typical of action-oriented titles. However, it does involve a fair amount of steering and maintaining altitude, which might require a bit of focus that could distract you during your treadmill or biking sessions. Finding the right balance between keeping your eyes on the aircraft and your workout can be a slight challenge, especially during more intricate maneuvers.

## Computer Requirements

This game does not skimp on its technical demands. Running Microsoft Flight Simulator at peak performance requires a solid gaming rig. To truly enjoy the visually stunning graphics and smooth frame rates, a powerful CPU and GPU setup is essential, with recommended specs leaning towards high-end gaming computers. If you plan on running this game while exercising, you’ll need to ensure your system can handle it without lagging—especially if you’re wanting to run or bike while flying through the clouds.

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) 40th Anniversary Edition creates an exhilarating flying experience that can augment workout sessions on a treadmill or bike, albeit with a few distractions.
