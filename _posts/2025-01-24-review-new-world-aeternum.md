# New World: Aeternum – Game Review 

In the vast, uncharted territories of Aeternum, Amazon Games has crafted an MMO that blends exploration, survival, and role-playing elements. But as a gamer who enjoys staying active, the question remains: Is "New World: Aeternum" a worthy companion on your treadmill or bike? Let’s dive in.

## Gameplay 

"New World: Aeternum" immerses players in a captivating environment rich with lore and the thrill of discovery. As you traverse the island, engaging in quests, crafting, and battling mobs, the gameplay is both dynamic and engaging. The absence of long cutscenes ensures that your focus remains on the action, making it a great fit for those looking to maintain a rhythm while exercising. Combat requires varied tactics—while there are moments of slower pacing, generally, the gameplay transitions smoothly, preventing any stalling of your momentum on the treadmill or bike. Overall, the combination of exploration and action keeps your heart pumping in more ways than one. 

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility 

One of the standout features of "New World" is its compatibility with controller input, allowing for a more laid-back experience while on the move. The game's combat style mostly relies on timing and positioning rather than quick reflexes, enabling players to maintain their footing while navigating the world. However, certain encounters can demand more hand-eye coordination than others, so depending on your playstyle, be prepared for segments where you may need to momentarily focus on your screen rather than your exercise. That said, the overall design is versatile enough that it's generally easy to play while staying active.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements 

"New World: Aeternum" does have a somewhat demanding setup. While it isn't the heaviest game out there, those aiming for higher settings (such as 60 FPS at ultra in dense areas) will need a robust system. A mid-range gaming PC shouldn't have much trouble running it, but it’s wise to check your specs and, if necessary, consider lowering graphic settings for smoother gameplay—especially when multitasking with physical activity. A solid internet connection is also key, as an MMO experience relies heavily on server stability to maintain the world and your interactions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score 

In conclusion, "New World: Aeternum" presents an engaging experience for gamers looking to maintain their fitness routine. With immersive gameplay that keeps you active and controller compatibility, it strikes a solid balance for treadmill and bike use, despite its moderate system requirements. While there are moments that may pull you into the screen, they are brief and won't derail your exercise goals. 

### Overall Score: 2.17 out of 3 

In short, if you're ready to conquer Aeternum while keeping your fitness journey alive, this game makes a formidable companion. So gear up, strap in, and enjoy the adventure—all while breaking a sweat!
