Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Company of Heroes 2,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Company of Heroes 2 Game Review

"Company of Heroes 2," a real-time strategy game set during World War II, immerses players in tactical warfare with a focus on squad-based combat, compelling storytelling, and dynamic environments. As a fan of both video games and fitness, I was intrigued to see how well this title would fare in an exercise setting, particularly while on a treadmill or biking. 

# Gameplay

The gameplay in "Company of Heroes 2" is engaging, pulling players into the tactical intricacies of battlefield commands. You will command squads, capture territories, and use cover effectively while keeping an eye on resource management. The missions are structured in a way that allows for brief periods of intense action followed by strategic planning, which could be great for integrating with a workout routine. However, there are moments with slower pacing, particularly during cutscenes or when waiting for resources to build up. These moments can sometimes disrupt the rhythm of a workout, especially if you’re aiming to maintain an elevated heart rate.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

"Company of Heroes 2" is primarily designed for mouse and keyboard controls, but it does have some compatibility with gamepads. However, the gameplay requires quick thinking and strategic moves, which can lead to moments of frantic clicking and precision aiming. This could pose a bit of a challenge while trying to pedal steadily or run on a treadmill without becoming distracted. If you can maintain focus while engaging with the game, you might find yourself just fine; if not, you could risk losing your workout momentum as you struggle with the controls while trying to stay fit.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The game is moderately demanding on system resources. To enjoy a smooth experience with decent graphics, a mid-range gaming setup—such as a quad-core processor, 4GB RAM, and a dedicated graphics card—is recommended. This means players can comfortably run the game while multitasking, though older hardware may struggle, leading to potential lag or frame drops that could detract from both the gaming experience and the workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, "Company of Heroes 2" delivers a compelling blend of strategy and immersive gameplay that can keep you engaged for hours. While it has appealing elements for exercise enthusiasts, such as periods of relaxation to plan your next moves, the pacing can occasionally detract from a consistent workout. With moderate system requirements and mouse and keyboard controls, it might not find its ideal rhythm on the treadmill or bike for everyone. 

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
