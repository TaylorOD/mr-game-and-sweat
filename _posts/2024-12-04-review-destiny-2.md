Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Destiny 2,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

## Destiny 2 Review

Destiny 2 is a widely acclaimed online multiplayer first-person shooter that invites players into a richly designed sci-fi universe filled with engaging narratives, varied gameplay modes, and a vibrant community. But how does it fare when it comes to providing an exercise-friendly experience while running on a treadmill or biking? Let’s dive into the various aspects.

# Gameplay

Destiny 2’s gameplay is a whirlwind of action, which consists of fast-paced combat, engaging quests, and exciting raid mechanics. The game’s missions are well-paced, delivering a blend of shooting, strategic power usage, and exploration. While the narrative elements can slow down the tempo with cutscenes, they are usually brief and tend to occur during mission transitions or before boss fights, rather than interrupting continuous gameplay. This ensures that players can keep their heart rates up while immersing themselves in the world of Guardians. The periodic adrenaline spikes from intense combat encounters can serve as a motivator to keep moving and maintain your workout.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Destiny 2 is highly compatible with treadmill and bike setups, particularly with its robust controller support. You can easily navigate through the game using a controller without the need for rapid reflexes or quick mouse movements—traits often detrimental to exercise. Overall, the demand for precision aiming is balanced, and although some encounters might require quick dodges or movements, these can mostly be handled with comfortable adjustments rather than frantic gestures. However, it's advisable to keep your pace balanced; as with many first-person shooters, staying stationary while being highly engaged could lead to distractions from your workout routine.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Destiny 2 does require a bit of horsepower, especially if you aim to enjoy the game in higher resolutions and frame rates. The game provides a range of customizable settings to optimize performance based on your hardware. Although some players might experience lag on lower-end systems, Destiny 2 is generally well-optimized for the majority of modern gaming rigs. However, ensure that your gaming setup meets or exceeds the minimum requirements to enjoy a smooth experience while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Destiny 2 creates a captivating gaming experience that combines thrilling action with community engagement. While the gameplay does have its slower moments, it mostly maintains a pace that keeps you moving, making it an excellent candidate for treadmill or cycling workouts. Its solid controller support and manageable requirements for modern computers lend themselves well to energetic exercise. All in all, if you’re seeking a game that enhances your workout with an engaging backdrop, Destiny 2 is worth considering.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
