# Dishonored 2: A Game Review for the Active Gamer

Dishonored 2, developed by Arkane Studios, immerses players in a beautifully crafted steampunk world. As the sequel to the critically-acclaimed Dishonored, this title expands upon the rich lore and gameplay mechanics while offering choices that profoundly impact your experience. But how does it fit into a fitness routine involving treadmill runs or bicycle rides? Let's delve in.

# Gameplay

Dishonored 2 excels in its gameplay variety, allowing players to choose between two protagonists: Emily Kaldwin or Corvo Attano. Each character offers unique abilities and playstyles, adding depth and replayability. The game encourages strategic thinking and creativity, allowing for stealthy approaches or all-out combat, depending on your preference. However, while the action is generally engaging, the pacing can ebb and flow, with extended exploration segments and occasional lengthy cutscenes that might pull you out of your exercise rhythm. Fortunately, the overall gameplay flow is dynamic, enabling you to find breaks between running or pedaling, yet, be prepared for some downtime.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

From a fitness perspective, Dishonored 2 is relatively accommodating. It supports a standard controller scheme, which is essential for players bringing their gaming experience to the treadmill or stationary bike. However, the game doesn’t demand twitch-reaction gameplay; instead, it rewards patience and strategic thinking. Players can navigate the game’s environments at a comfortable pace, with slow exploration allowing for simultaneous exercise without needing to compromise focus. Yet, intense combat sequences may temporarily distract you from your workout, so it’s best to adjust your intensity when the action heightens.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Dishonored 2 is graphically demanding, which means your PC should be relatively modern for optimal performance. The recommended requirements suggest a decent mid-range setup with a GPU akin to the NVIDIA GTX 780 or better and at least 8 GB of RAM. Make sure to have your system capable of handling the graphics settings, especially if you plan on losing yourself in the detailed environments while putting in those aerobic miles.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, Dishonored 2 is a great game that offers engaging gameplay and an innovative immersive experience, making it a good choice for gamers who want to exercise simultaneously. Its compatibility with treadmill and bike usage is decent, though some pacing issues and intense moments might require adjusting how you balance your workouts with the intricacies of gameplay. Overall, this sequel brilliantly captures what made the first game special while building upon its foundations—making it a worthy addition to your gaming and fitness arsenal.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
