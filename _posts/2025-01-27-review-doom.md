DOOM excels when it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike setup. The controls are intuitive, with customizable button mapping, allowing you to get comfortable before diving into the fray.

In terms of computer requirements, DOOM demands a decent setup to really get the most out of its slick graphics and high-speed gameplay.

While the experience may not be as immersive on lower-spec devices, you'll still be able to engage in demon-slaying action while maintaining your stride. Just be sure to optimize your setup to avoid any lag that could disrupt your workout.
