**Gameplay**  
Cookie Clicker is an incremental game that thrives on a simple yet addictive premise: you click on a cookie to earn more cookies, which you then use to purchase upgrades that automatically generate even more cookies. The gameplay loop is satisfying and can easily keep players engaged as they watch their cookie count skyrocket. 

While playing, you can set it down and let the numbers climb, making it an excellent distraction while you focus on your treadmill or stationary bike. There are minimal slow sections; the game is designed to be engaging and to keep you coming back for more with its endless upgrades and achievements. The absence of long cutscenes means you can easily glance over every couple of seconds to check your progress without feeling pulled away from your workout.
