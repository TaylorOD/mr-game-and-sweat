Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Grounded,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Game Review: Grounded

Grounded is an innovative survival adventure game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, where players find themselves shrunk down to the size of an ant in a suburban backyard. As you navigate this miniaturized world, you confront insects, gather resources, and build your own base to survive. It’s a captivating premise that offers a seamless blend of crafting, exploration, and survival mechanics.

# Gameplay 

The gameplay in Grounded is highly engaging. You'll find yourself running, jumping, and climbing throughout the vibrant environment, which has been meticulously crafted with a plethora of details. The objectives are clear, and the sense of progression is satisfying as you upgrade your gear and discover new crafting recipes. There are no lengthy cutscenes that disrupt your experience, which is perfect for keeping your heart rate elevated while you’re on the treadmill or bike. The game's pacing keeps you on your toes, but the ability to explore at your leisure allows for a more relaxed mode if you need a breather.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Grounded excels in compatibility with both treadmill and bike setups. The game is played primarily from a first-person perspective, which makes it easier to keep the gaming experience engaging while exercising. The controls are responsive, allowing you to navigate with a game controller comfortably. While some action sequences might require quick reflexes (especially when dealing with aggressive insects), they don’t demand the precise, rapid movements that can throw you off balance on a treadmill. You can still focus on your workout and adjust your intensity as needed while having fun in the game.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side, Grounded is reasonably demanding but not excessively so. Players will need a system that meets the minimum requirements of an Intel i5-2500 or AMD FX-6100 with at least 8 GB of RAM and a GTX 650 or Radeon R7 360. While it doesn't require a high-end gaming rig, those who opt for more significant graphical settings or want a smoother experience will likely want to invest in a more robust system. However, considering most modern PCs can handle it, it shouldn’t be a barrier for the average player.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Grounded successfully captures the essence of survival and adventure in a unique miniaturized world that’s perfect for both gaming enthusiasts and those looking to maintain their fitness routines. The engaging gameplay will distract you just enough from the grind of a treadmill or bike while still forcing you to maintain focus and balance. While more intense moments may interrupt the flow, they are well-integrated into the overall experience. Ultimately, Grounded is a great choice for fitness gaming, offering just the right blend of challenge, exploration, and adrenaline.

### Overall Score: 2.3 out of 3
