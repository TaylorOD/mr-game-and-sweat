Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, weâ€™re tackling "Cyberpunk 2077,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Cyberpunk 2077 Game Review

Despite its rocky launch, "Cyberpunk 2077" has evolved into a rich, engaging experience set in a sprawling open world that embodies the essence of a dystopian future. As a game that combines role-playing elements with extensive customization and storytelling, it is crucial to see how well it performs when combined with exercises like running or biking.

# Gameplay

"Cyberpunk 2077" offers an extensive blend of fast-paced action and narrative-driven quests. Players navigate the vibrant Night City, embarking on missions that require a mix of stealth, combat, and decision-making. The gameplay can be quite engaging, with enough excitement to keep your heart rate up as you sprint or cycle. While there are slower sections and some lengthy cutscenes, they often provide an opportunity to catch your breath and enjoy the story. However, excessive dialogue can occasionally disrupt the momentum of your workout, so balance is key.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

The game features full controller compatibility, which is a significant bonus for those looking to game while exercising. However, "Cyberpunk 2077" often demands quick reflexes and precise maneuvers, especially during combat scenarios. This could potentially distract you from keeping a steady pace on a treadmill or bike. The more methodical moments in the game may help you stay engaged without losing focus on your workout, but the frenetic pace of certain missions may make it challenging to maintain balance.

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

"Cyberpunk 2077" is known for its demanding system requirements, making it essential to ensure your computer is up to the task. You'll need a relatively powerful machine with substantial RAM and a strong graphics card to fully enjoy the game's striking visuals. This may not be as detrimental to a treadmill or bike workout, but it does create a hurdle for those using less capable setups, thereby limiting accessibility.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

"Cyberpunk 2077" offers a riveting experience that can indeed accompany your workouts, but it requires a level of caution with its pacing and gameplay style. While the fast-paced action can spike your adrenaline, be wary of longer cutscenes and demanding reflexes that might break your rhythm. Overall, if you're prepared for the requirements, you can enjoy a thrilling ride through Night City while breaking a sweat.

### Overall Score: 1.83 out of 3
