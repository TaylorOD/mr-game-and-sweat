# Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition Review

Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition is a grand strategy game that impresses both strategy enthusiasts and history buffs alike. But can it hold your attention while you're running on a treadmill or biking? Let's break it down.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in ROME II is incredibly engaging, offering a blend of real-time battles and turn-based tactics that keeps your mind busy while your legs pump away. There's just enough action on the battlefield to keep you riveted, with historical sieges and skirmishes demanding strategic thinking without overwhelming you. The game features a captivating campaign map and intense battles that can suck players in for hours. However, be warned: the game does include some slower sections, particularly during diplomacy and AI turns that can stretch out the gameplay, potentially forcing you to slow down your workout. Overall, the experience is generally rewarding, just be prepared for occasional lulls.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with the treadmill or bike, ROME II scores high thanks to its controller support. The game primarily requires strategic planning rather than quick reflexes. This makes it easier to manage while exercising, as you can take your time to plot your moves. However, the periodic intensity of battles might require brief spikes in concentration that can pull your focus away from your workout. While it’s not perfect for fast-paced input, it’s certainly playable during moderate exercise.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Total War: ROME II can be slightly demanding on your computer, especially during large-scale battles that can involve hundreds of units on-screen simultaneously. While it runs on a wide range of setups, a decent CPU and a capable GPU will ensure smoother performance. Users on older hardware may experience choppiness during high-action scenes, which could affect your engagement level while exercising. If you want to keep things streaming seamlessly while you run or bike, it's worth checking that your system meets the recommended specs.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition is a strategic tour de force that provides substantial engagement while you're exercising, albeit with a few slow moments that may disrupt your rhythm. The controller compatibility and lack of quick reflex gameplay make it a solid choice for treadmill or biking warriors. Just make sure your computer can handle the demands of the game if you want to avoid any distractions that might derail your workout.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
