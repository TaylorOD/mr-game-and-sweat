Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "GRIS,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# GRIS Game Review

"GRIS," developed by Nomada Studio, is an indie platformer that transcends the traditional gaming experience through its enchanting art style and evocative soundtrack. However, when it comes to exercising while gaming, there are several aspects to consider regarding gameplay, compatibility with workout equipment, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

The gameplay experience in "GRIS" is captivating and visually stunning, characterized by its fluid platforming mechanics and seamless transitions between different environmental elements, all while progressing through the story of loss and growth. As players guide the titular character, GRIS, through a series of beautifully crafted landscapes, the focus remains on exploration rather than high-paced action. The gameplay is generally engaging, with soothing puzzles and gentle platforming that allows for a meditative experience.

However, there are sections that can feel methodical, and some players may find themselves waiting for the next part of the level to unfold. The lack of urgency in the pacing can be both a blessing and a curse during workouts; while it allows for a calm experience, it may also result in moments where your run or ride feels too slow-paced to hold your attention fully.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

GRIS is relatively well-suited for gameplay while running or biking, thanks to its minimalistic control scheme. The game utilizes simple joystick movements, making it compatible with various controllers, which is a definite plus. You won't need quick reflexes or precise timing, allowing you to maintain your momentum without any undue interruption.

Nevertheless, because much of the gameplay is leisurely, those looking for an intense workout might find themselves feeling disengaged at times—especially during segments where the scenery shifts and the game's meditative tempo slows down.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The good news for those considering playing GRIS on a computer is that it is not particularly demanding. The game can run on modest hardware, meaning you don’t need an overly powerful system to enjoy its beauty. With a minimum requirement of a dual-core CPU and integrated graphics, even older devices should be able to handle it without difficulty.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, "GRIS" offers a unique and immersive experience, marrying breath-taking visuals with a poignant narrative. For exercising enthusiasts, its tranquil gameplay allows for a relaxed treadmill or biking experience, though the slower segments may occasionally distract from your workout. Nevertheless, its accessibility on various systems makes it an excellent choice to enhance your gaming workout routine.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
