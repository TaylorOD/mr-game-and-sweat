Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Ultimate Custom Night,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Ultimate Custom Night Review

Ultimate Custom Night (U.C.N) is the latest installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise, delivering a unique sandbox experience where you can customize your own night at Freddy’s pizzeria. As an enthusiast of both video games and fitness, I've tested this game on a treadmill to see how well it fits into an active gaming lifestyle.

# Gameplay

U.C.N is a masterclass in tension and engagement. The gameplay revolves around managing various animatronics, each with its unique mechanics, while trying to survive until 6 AM. The customizable options create a satisfying balance of challenge and strategy. Notably, there are no long cutscenes or slow sections; every moment counts as you frantically monitor your cameras and manage power. This constant engagement keeps you focused, ensuring that you remain mentally challenged while sprinting or pedaling away. However, the game's jump scares can cause the heart to race faster—not always a bad thing for those looking to push their limits on the treadmill!

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Ultimate Custom Night can be played with a keyboard, making it easy to engage while you’re on a treadmill or bike. However, it does demand quick reactions, particularly in moments where you must quickly shut doors or adjust cameras. If you're running or biking at higher speeds, this could lead to some awkward moments, but with practice, you can build your coordination. As it’s designed for shorter, more intense sessions, you won't find yourself struggling through long turns or complex maneuvers that require precision while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

In terms of performance, U.C.N is fairly light on system resources. It doesn’t demand a high-end computer given its 2D graphics and relatively simple mechanics. Most modern computers should easily handle it, meaning you won’t need to skip a workout session just to ensure your system is up to date. It runs well even on machines that aren’t gamer's best friends, allowing you to focus more on your health and less on tech worries.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Ultimate Custom Night is an impressive addition to the franchise that successfully combines an engaging gameplay loop with the potential for a unique exercise experience. Despite its slightly demanding reaction requirements on a treadmill or bike, the overall compatibility with fitness activities shines through. If you’re looking to survive the night while keeping your heart rate up, U.C.N is an excellent choice that will keep you on your toes—literally!

### Overall Score: 2.67 out of 3
