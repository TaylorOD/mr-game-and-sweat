# Kenshi: A Review for the Gamers Who Exercise

Kenshi is an open-world, sandbox RPG developed by Lo-Fi Games, known for its unique blend of survival, exploration, and strategy. It drops players into a brutal post-apocalyptic world where they must fend for themselves, build their own factions, and survive against the odds. So, how does this expansive adventure stack up for gamers looking to squeeze in cardio on the treadmill or bike? Let’s dive in.

# Gameplay

Kenshi's gameplay is highly engaging and immersive, allowing players to lose themselves in a vast world filled with opportunities and challenges. The game’s open-ended design means there are no rigid cut scenes or lengthy dialogues to break your focus; instead, gameplay flows seamlessly, allowing you to manage your squad, explore, and engage in various activities while you run or bike. Due to the tactical nature of the game, you can take your time to plan your next move, all while maintaining a rhythm on your treadmill or bike. However, depending on your playstyle, some moments can be less action-packed, particularly when you’re waiting for your characters to complete long journeys or engage in farming activities.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with exercise equipment, Kenshi has a few advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the game supports controller input, making it easier to play while in motion. Your character's movements can be managed with simple controls, allowing you to perform tasks without needing rapid, twitch-based inputs that could throw off your exercise routine. However, be mindful that some aspects, like managing combat or intricate strategies, may require more focused attention. If you’re on a treadmill, it’s possible that you may periodically need to focus more intently on the screen, which can detract from the ease of running. On a bike, the slower-paced elements and strategic planning lend themselves well, allowing for a more balanced workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Kenshi is relatively lightweight in terms of system demands compared to many modern AAA titles. It runs smoothly on a variety of hardware, offering decent performance even on mid-range systems. The game’s graphics aren't groundbreaking but provide a gritty atmosphere fitting for its setting. This is a plus for those exercising, as it ensures you won't be too distracted by hardware limitations or performance drops while you're trying to keep a steady pace.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Overall, Kenshi offers a unique, engaging experience that can be enjoyed while exercising, especially for those who appreciate slower-paced, strategic gameplay. While it isn’t perfect for keeping your heart rate high throughout, its sandbox design and controller accessibility make it a solid choice for treadmill or bike sessions. Just be wary of those slower moments that might take your focus away from your workout. 

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
