Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Squad,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Squad Game Review

Squad is a tactical multiplayer shooter that emphasizes team play and communication, making it a unique addition to the genre. It’s not just about individual skill; it’s about working together to secure objectives and control the battlefield. This cooperative gameplay can provide an engaging distraction from your workout, but how well does it really translate into a game that you can enjoy while on a treadmill or bike? Let’s break it down.

## Gameplay
The gameplay of Squad is both strategic and immersive. Players engage in large-scale battles that require coordination, tactical planning, and teamwork. The matches are structured around capturing objectives, which develops a sense of purpose and urgency. The constant action and communication between players keep your mind occupied and engaged, making it easier to forget about the grind of your treadmill or bike. However, the game does feature some downtime while organizing squads and responding to orders; this slow-paced communication can occasionally disrupt your rhythm, especially if you're focusing heavily on your workout. Still, the adrenaline rush from a successful ambush or a well-coordinated offensive is hard to beat.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility
Squad is best played with a controller or keyboard, which can be tricky while trying to sustain a rigorous workout on a treadmill or bike. While its tactical nature allows for some level of relaxed gameplay, it also requires players to make strategic decisions quickly and maintain communication, often through voice chat. Players might find themselves needing to use their hands continuously, which can be challenging if you’re trying to keep up a good pace on your machine. Fortunately, most of Squads' action is moderately paced, which can be accommodating for those looking to exercise, but it might not suit users who prefer fast-paced twitch gameplay while riding or running.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements
Squad has moderately high system requirements, primarily due to its large maps and detailed graphics that bring the battlefield to life. You'll ideally need a decent gaming PC with a mid-range graphics card to enjoy the game to its fullest potential. This could mean that if you're on a less capable machine, you might not have the best experience, potentially leading to lag, especially during high-action sequences. However, for most modern setups, it runs smoothly, and the visuals can be stunning, drawing you further into its immersive world.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score
Overall, Squad is a compelling choice for gamers looking to enjoy a tactical shooter while balancing fitness goals. While the gameplay is engaging and relatively accommodating to moderate workouts, the need for controller usage makes it a bit clunky for super high-intensity routines. If you’re looking for something that can keep your mind engaged while you maintain a solid sweat session, it fits the bill, but be aware of its limitations in terms of pacing and computer requirements.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
