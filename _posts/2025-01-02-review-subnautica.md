# Subnautica Game Review

If you're looking for a captivating underwater adventure that keeps you engaged while getting your sweat on, Subnautica might be the perfect match for your treadmill or bike sessions. Let’s dive into the details!

# Gameplay 

Subnautica is an immersive survival game set in the depths of an alien ocean. You start with limited resources, forcing you to explore and gather materials to build your base and survive. The pacing is particularly well-designed; while there are moments of intense exploration and discovery, there are also ample slower periods where you can focus on crafting and completing quests. This balance allows for a very engaging experience that won't fully distract you from your workout. 

Match this with the stunning visuals and haunting soundscape, and you may find yourself mysteriously drawn into the game without realizing how much time has passed—all the while making your treadmill run or cycling a more enjoyable activity. There are no lengthy cutscenes; rather, you get absorbed in gradually piecing together the narrative while on the move.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3 

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Subnautica is well-suited for both treadmill and bike compatibility due to its controller support and the relative ease of movement required. The gameplay primarily involves exploration and resource gathering, which can be done at a manageable pace. There aren’t any quick-time events or frantic button presses necessary, which means you won’t have to fumble around for your controller mid-stride. However, there are some fight sequences with hostile creatures that might require more intense focus. Nevertheless, the majority of gameplay is smooth and well-suited for exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3 

# Computer Requirements

Subnautica's system requirements are moderate; while it can run on a range of systems, a decent graphics card is recommended to fully appreciate the beautiful underwater aesthetics. A powerful enough machine will ensure smooth performance, especially with the vast, detailed environments you’ll be exploring. Players who are equipped with rigs that meet at least the minimum requirements should experience minimal lag, allowing for a seamless experience while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3 

# Conclusion and Score
