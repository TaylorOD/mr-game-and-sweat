## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike, "Path of Exile 2" shines brightly. The game supports controllers, allowing you to move around seamlessly without needing to focus too heavily on keyboard and mouse setups, which can be cumbersome during a workout. Additionally, while the game encourages skillful dodging and strategic positioning at times, it does not demand quick reflexes or highly precise inputs that could interrupt your exercise rhythm. You can comfortably play at a moderate pace, making it friendly for fitness gamers.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

As an ambitious sequel, "Path of Exile 2" does come with some moderate computer requirements. While it doesn’t demand the latest hardware available, you'll want a decent GPU and CPU for smooth gameplay, especially as the ahead-of-its-time graphics push more pixels on-screen during combat. If you’re looking to join the path on a low-spec machine, prepare for some compromises in performance. However, if you're using a gaming rig, this should not pose any issues.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Overall, "Path of Exile 2" is a triumphant return to the franchise, delivering addictive gameplay that meshes wonderfully with a workout routine. Its engaging combat mechanics and controller compatibility make it an excellent choice for those looking to balance their love for gaming with fitness.
