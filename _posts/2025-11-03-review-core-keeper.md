# Core Keeper Review

Core Keeper is an innovative indie game that takes players deep underground into an expansive cavern filled with mystery and adventure. It's an intriguing blend of exploration, crafting, and survival, all set within a charming pixel-art world. Most importantly, it's a game that can easily accompany you during your exercise routine, whether you're on a treadmill or cycling.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay mechanics in Core Keeper revolve around resource gathering, crafting, and exploration. You begin with a few essential tools and a tiny base, and from there, the world opens up as you discover new resources, enemies, and mechanics. The game encourages players to dig deeper and uncover the treasures and dangers hidden below the surface.

The engaging gameplay elements keep your mind stimulated, which is a plus when you're trying to stay focused during a workout. Activities like gathering resources, building your base, and battling underground creatures keep your hands busy, but they don’t require twitch reflexes or quick movements that could throw off your exercise routine. There's a nice balance where interruptions are minimal, with no long cutscenes or tedious slow sections to bog you down.

The slower-paced nature and cooperative elements make it perfect for easily managing your attention on the screen without needing to perform rapid movements. 

You can casually maintain your pace as you dig, craft, and explore while also potentially commuting with friends in multiplayer mode. This game allows players to become engrossed without feeling overwhelmed, making it ideal for maintaining focus during your workout.
