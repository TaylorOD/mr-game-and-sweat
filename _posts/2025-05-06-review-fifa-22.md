Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "FIFA 22,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# FIFA 22 Review

FIFA 22 brings back the exhilarating simulation that fans of the franchise have come to love, but how does it fare as a game that can accompany your treadmill runs or bike rides? Let's take a closer look.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in FIFA 22 is both engaging and fast-paced, perfect for keeping your heart rate up while you sweat it out. The matches are dynamic, featuring realistic ball physics and player movements that keep you on your toes. There’s an enjoyable mix of thrill and strategy as you carve your way through defenses and work on your goal-scoring tactics. Thankfully, cutscenes are minimal and brief, allowing you to maintain your rhythm without too many interruptions. You can immerse yourself in a crucial match without losing focus on your exercise routine. Thanks to the fluid nature of the gameplay, you might even find yourself running a little faster or pedaling a bit harder during those nail-biting moments!

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

FIFA 22 holds up well when it comes to compatibility with treadmill and bike workouts. Originally designed for consoles or PC, using a game controller makes it easier to manage your movements without needing extensive hand-eye coordination. Although there are quick reflex plays and precise moments—such as timing a through ball or executing a deft skill move—these don't require you to frantically swipe buttons or execute complex maneuvers. Instead, you can settle into a comfortable pace while still being actively involved in the gameplay. This makes it a great way to blast through a cardio session while enjoying some quality gaming time.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

FIFA 22 is moderately demanding when it comes to its computer requirements. To really enjoy the game with smooth graphics and fast load times, you'll need a decent CPU and GPU, which may be a limitation for some. That said, if you own a general gaming setup, you should have no trouble running it. The game can be played at lower settings on mid-range computers, which is a plus for users with lesser hardware. However, be prepared for a noticeable dip in performance if you prioritize high resolutions or frame rates while multitasking with your exercise.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Overall, FIFA 22 is an excellent choice for those looking to merge gaming with their exercise routines. With its engaging gameplay that keeps your heart racing, solid compatibility with controllers during a workout, and manageable computer requirements, it offers an entertaining way to stay active. While there are slight compromises on hardware demands, those are easily overshadowed by the enjoyable experience FIFA 22 provides.

### Overall Score: 2.67 out of 3
