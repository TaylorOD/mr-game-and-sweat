Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "MORDHAU,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# MORDHAU Game Review

## Gameplay

MORDHAU's gameplay is frenetic and highly engaging, putting players right in the middle of large-scale medieval battles. The combination of skill-based melee combat and strategic team play keeps the adrenaline flowing, making it an ideal companion for those looking to distract themselves while on the treadmill or bike. With no lengthy cutscenes to interrupt the action, players can focus on mastering the art of combat, dodging enemy strikes, and coordinating with teammates. The spontaneity and variety of engagements ensure that you're always on your toes, which can make for an exciting workout session. 

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

MORDHAU supports controller compatibility, which is a strong plus for players looking to exercise on a treadmill or bike. The game does require a degree of quick reflexes and hand-eye coordination, particularly during intense skirmishes or when managing multiple foes. However, it’s the type of dynamic that can easily be balanced with moderate gym activity—most players find that rhythmic footwork or consistent pedaling can sync well with the game's flow. That said, players who enjoy extreme twitch mechanics might find it difficult to maintain their balance while turning or swinging wildly, but overall, it adapts well to physical activity.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

MORDHAU isn't overly demanding in terms of performance, but you do want a moderately capable machine to run it smoothly. A decent mid-range PC with a graphics card and processor from the last few years will suffice for a seamless experience. Depending on your settings and the number of players in a match, it can run from 30 to 60 FPS without breaking a sweat. This accessibility makes it appealing for gamers with different setups, but those with lower-end machines may experience some hiccups in performance during chaotic moments.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

MORDHAU offers an exhilarating gameplay experience that seamlessly fits the active lifestyle of exercising while gaming. Its engaging combat, strong controller compatibility, and reasonable computer requirements make it a solid choice for gamers who want to hit that cardio goal without sacrificing their gaming passion. While there are minor challenges in managing quick movements on a treadmill or bike, the overall engagement more than compensates. 

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
