# Sid Meier’s Civilization VI: A Game Review for Gamers Who Love to Exercise

**Gameplay**

Sid Meier's Civilization VI offers an engaging and immersive experience that can easily wrap you into its world of building empires and strategizing for dominance. The gameplay revolves around turn-based mechanics, which allow for thoughtful planning and decision-making. Unlike action-packed games that require constant attention, Civilization VI grants you the freedom to manage your time and focus on the game, making it adaptable to your treadmill or biking routine. There are limited lengthy cutscenes that could disrupt your workout rhythm. In fact, the game encourages you to strategize as you run or pedal, making it a mentally stimulating exercise companion.

**Treadmill and Bike Compatibility**

One of the highlights of Civilization VI is its controller compatibility, allowing you to enjoy gameplay without the need for a mouse and keyboard. This is particularly advantageous while you’re on a treadmill or stationary bike. The game doesn’t require rapid reflexes or twitch-based reactions, so you can maintain a consistent pace without feeling overwhelmed. The turn-based nature means that you can focus on your workout without risking a game-over situation, and you can utilize your rest periods to plan your next civilization move. Overall, it strikes a balance, allowing for an enjoyable exercise experience.

**Computer Requirements**

Civilization VI is moderately demanding in terms of hardware. While you don’t need an overly powerful rig to run it, having a decent CPU and GPU will ensure smooth graphics and overall performance. On lower-end machines, you may experience occasional lags, especially during late-game turns when the map is filled with units and cities, which can be a distraction for users trying to focus on their workout. A recommended setup would typically include a recent generation processor, 8GB of RAM, and a mid-range graphics card to enjoy the game at its best.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

**Conclusion and Score**

Sid Meier’s Civilization VI impresses with its engaging gameplay and compatibility for your fitness routine. You can enjoy hours of strategic planning and diplomatic maneuvering while maintaining your exercise regimen, thanks to its turn-based mechanics and controller support. While it has moderate computer requirements that could impact less powerful setups, the overall experience makes it a worthy addition to your gaming library, particularly for those who value fitness while enjoying video games.
