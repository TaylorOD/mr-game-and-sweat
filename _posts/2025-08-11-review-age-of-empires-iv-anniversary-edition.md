# Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition Review

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition brings back the iconic real-time strategy (RTS) formula that captivated players for decades, now polished to a shine with updated graphics and gameplay improvements. But how well does it hold up, especially for avid gamers who want to stay active on a treadmill or bike? Let's dive into the details.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Age of Empires IV moves at a solid pace, drawing you into its strategic depth without becoming overwhelming. Players will find satisfaction in managing their resources, building empires, and engaging in battles while maintaining a watchful eye on their growing civilizations. The game offers a variety of campaigns and skirmishes, each filled with tasks that encourage engagement without lengthy cutscenes or tiresome sections. The action is fluid, allowing you to seamlessly shift between combat and construction, making it quite easy to lose track of time on your run or ride.

However, there are moments where the game’s strategic nature may cause you to focus more intently on your decisions. For instance, during critical battles, you may find yourself halting your workout to fully plan your moves, which could disrupt your rhythm. Overall, it strikes a balance, keeping you engaged while allowing you to intermittently focus on your exercise.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike, Age of Empires IV is more favorable than many titles in its genre. The game supports controller input, which is a significant plus. You can comfortably maneuver your armies and issue orders without the need for a rapid mouse response, allowing you to maintain your workout’s pace. The gameplay does not require quick reflexes or twitch movements, as tactical planning is the key to success.

Yet, be mindful that during intense moments—like when you’re launching a full-scale attack—your focus may unintentionally shift from monitoring your effort level on the treadmill or bike. Being strategic can require some mental engagement that might divert you slightly from your workout. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition sports stunning graphics and a wealth of content, but with that comes a moderate demand on your computer. To enjoy the game at its best, you’ll need a machine with at least an Intel i5 or AMD equivalent processor, 8 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 or AMD RX 560 graphics card. While these specs aren't outlandish, they ensure that you won’t have any lag issues—an important factor when you’re trying to maintain focus during your workouts.

Some players might find themselves challenged if their setup is less powerful, but overall, most should be able to enjoy the game without severe tech requirements.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Age of Empires IV: Anniversary Edition does a commendable job of blending engaging gameplay with an accessible experience for those who want to stay active. While you may occasionally need to focus more on the game than your workout, it offers a mix of strategy that keeps you engaged without overly taxing your attention. 

Overall, whether you’re biding your time on a treadmill or cycling away, it proves to be an entertaining companion amid your cardio sessions. 

### Overall Score: 2.17 out of 3
