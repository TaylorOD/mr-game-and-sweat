# Review of "Unturned"

"Unturned" is a unique take on the zombie survival genre. Initially released as a free-to-play game on Steam, it quickly gained traction for its blocky aesthetic reminiscent of classic titles like Minecraft, combined with an extensive crafting system and multiplayer aspects. As more gamers turn towards an exercise-centric lifestyle, finding games that blend well with physical activity is key. Let’s dive into how well "Unturned" holds up in this context.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in "Unturned" is both engaging and dynamic, focusing on survival in a post-apocalyptic world filled with zombies. Players scavenge for supplies, build fortifications, and engage in combat with various enemies. The open-world format allows for exploration, which can keep your mind off the treadmill or bike, immersing you in a colorful yet dangerous environment. Importantly, there aren’t many slow sections or prolonged cutscenes; the action is typically fast-paced, keeping you entertained and distracted.
