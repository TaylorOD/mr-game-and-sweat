Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "NieR:Automata,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Review of NieR:Automata

NieR:Automata is an action RPG that offers a deeply engaging narrative set in a post-apocalyptic world, entwined with thought-provoking themes, immersive gameplay, and beautiful visuals. As a fitness enthusiast and avid gamer, I was curious to see how this title could fit into a treadmill or biking routine. Here’s the breakdown.

# Gameplay 

NieR:Automata features fast-paced combat and an engaging storyline that unfolds across multiple playthroughs. The action is fluid and keeps you on your toes, making each encounter exciting. However, the game does include lengthy cutscenes and slower dialogue sequences, which might pose a challenge if you’re trying to maintain an active workout pace. While the battles are intense and can distract you from running, some sections require you to stop for story moments. Overall, it strikes a balance but might pull you out of your workout rhythm occasionally.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility 

NieR:Automata is compatible with both keyboard and game controllers, allowing for flexibility in setup. The game’s combat system does involve a range of movements, such as dodging, jumping, and using special abilities, which can make it difficult to maintain form while exercising. Some quick reflexes are required, which may hinder your ability to keep pace on a treadmill or bike. If you tend to play at a more leisurely pace, you might find the experience more enjoyable while staying active, though it can be a challenge during intense battles.

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements 

NieR:Automata requires a decent setup to run smoothly, particularly if you want to experience the stunning visuals in full glory. The minimum requirements include an Intel Core i3 or equivalent, along with 4 GB of RAM. For optimal performance, an Intel Core i5 and 8 GB of RAM are recommended. If you're playing on a laptop or an older computer, be prepared for potential performance hiccups, which could detract from your gameplay experience while trying to exercise.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score 

NieR:Automata is a phenomenal game that captivates with its storytelling and gameplay mechanics. However, its blend of intense action and slower narrative moments may disrupt your exercise routine on a treadmill or bike. If you're focused on your workout, you might face challenges staying engaged due to some cutscenes and intense combat mechanics. That being said, it's a captivating experience that makes it worth a play when you're not specifically focused on exercise.

### Overall Score: 1.83 out of 3
