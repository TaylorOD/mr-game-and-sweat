Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "DEVOUR,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

## DEVOUR Review

In the realm of cooperative horror gaming, “DEVOUR” stands out as an exhilarating experience that not only tests your nerve but also can combine surprisingly well with your at-home workout routines. Developed by Tread Lightly, this game brings together frantic gameplay and high-stakes survival mechanics, all wrapped in an unequivocally haunting atmosphere.

# Gameplay

“DEVOUR” plunges players into a nightmare where they must work collaboratively to stop a possessed cultist. The pacing is frenetic, with moments of both intense action and tense stealth gameplay. The horror elements add an engaging layer that keeps you on your toes—there’s never a dull moment as you dash from one location to another, gather items, and strategize with your teammates to complete objectives. 

The beauty of this game is that it thrives on quick decisions and constant movement, which is perfectly suited to those looking to multitask while exercising. There are minimal slow sections; even when you're planning your next move, the looming threat of the demonic antagonist ensures you stay alert and maintain your game face. Because the gameplay actively encourages movement and shared goals, it can keep you engaged enough to forget that you’re running or pedaling, so long as your setup is appropriate.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

“DEVOUR” is primarily designed for keyboard and mouse play, but it does support controllers, which is advantageous for those using a bike or treadmill setup. The game relies on strategic movement and teamwork, rather than requiring high-precision, reflex-based actions—this means you can keep your heart rate up without sacrificing gameplay quality.

However, if your treadmill or bike doesn’t allow for agile turns and quick movements, it might be a bit challenging at times, especially during those frantic escape sequences. Still, most players with a reasonable setup can find a rhythm that works for both fitness and gaming.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

DEVOUR is relatively light on system requirements, making it accessible to a wide audience. Minimum requirements suggest a dual-core processor with integrated graphics, showcasing that you don't need a gaming rig to enjoy the horror experience. Even if you're working on more modest hardware, you should expect reasonable performance, enabling you to devote your focus on both your cardio workout and the game without worrying about lag or frame rate drops.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In summary, “DEVOUR” is a captivating blend of horror, teamwork, and frantic gameplay that makes it suitable for gamers looking to boost their exercise routine. Its engaging nature keeps the adrenaline pumping while you stay active, ensuring you remain engaged without facing tedious gameplay segments. While it could use some fine-tuning for specific fitness setups, it is definitely a worthy addition to your gaming library for those who want to combine the thrill of horror with their workout.

### Overall Score: 2.3 out of 3
