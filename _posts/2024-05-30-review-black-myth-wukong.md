# Game Review: Black Myth: Wukong

Black Myth: Wukong is a breathtaking action-adventure game that transports players into a vibrant world inspired by Chinese mythology. Set as an adaptation of the classic tale "Journey to the West," players take on the role of the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong. The thrilling combat mechanics and engaging narrative combine to create a unique gaming experience.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Black Myth: Wukong is nothing short of exhilarating. With fast-paced combat, mechanics that reward skillful timing, and a rich atmosphere full of lore, you'll find yourself engrossed. Importantly, the pacing of the game is quite seamless, with few slow sections or lengthy cut scenes to interrupt the action.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or bike, Black Myth: Wukong earns mixed reviews. The game does support controllers, which is a plus, allowing for some flexibility in how you set up your exercise session. However, the combat demands a variety of quick movements, dodges, and timing-based actions, which could make it challenging to play while attempting to maintain a steady pace on a treadmill or stationary bike. If you’re used to multitasking during your gaming sessions, you may find it a bit more difficult with the intense reflexes required in this game.

### Category Score: 1.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

On the technical side, Black Myth: Wukong is a visually stunning game that demands a fair bit of power from your computer. It requires a robust graphics card and a solid processor to fully enjoy its rich graphics and smooth gameplay. Players will need to ensure their system meets the minimum requirements, which could serve as an extra hurdle for those gaming on less capable rigs. However, if you invest in a decent setup, the experience is rewarding.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Black Myth: Wukong is an enigmatic combination of captivating storytelling, responsive combat, and visually striking artwork that makes it a must-play for genre enthusiasts. While the game successfully engages players with its pacing, its more twitch-based gameplay presents a challenge for those trying to maintain their workout on a treadmill or stationary bike. The system requirements could also restrict access to some players, adding another consideration for those interested in this engaging yet demanding title.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3

In summary, if you’re looking for a game to dive into while you exercise, and you value an immersive experience, Black Myth: Wukong is worth trying. Just be prepared to slow things down a bit and focus fully on your workout!
