# Disco Elysium - The Final Cut: A Game Review

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut is a groundbreaking role-playing game that combines rich narrative, deep character development, and an intricate decision-making system. But how does it hold up as a companion for your treadmill or bike exercise routine? Let’s dive into the details.

# Gameplay

Disco Elysium offers a unique blend of dialogue-heavy gameplay and thought-provoking storytelling. You’ll spend much of your time exploring the intricate world of Revachol, interacting with quirky characters, and unraveling a murder mystery. The game leans heavily on text-based choices, providing you with an engaging experience that invites you to immerse yourself in the story. However, while the narrative pulls you in, these lengthy conversations can sometimes slow the pacing down, especially if you find yourself engrossed in the dialogue.

If your running rhythm gets disrupted by discussions that could stretch on, you might need to take extra care to maintain your pace. For workouts, especially if you're looking to push yourself, the slower sections may not align well with your desire to stay engaged in the physical challenge. Luckily, the game’s overall design means it can be played at a leisurely pace, so you won’t miss critical story elements if you need to focus on your workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with exercise equipment, Disco Elysium shines in its accessibility. The game supports controller play, which makes it feasible to navigate and select dialogue options without being tied to a keyboard. This can be advantageous for maintaining your fitness regimen while enjoying gaming, as it doesn't require frantic movements or twitch reflexes. 

However, the nature of the game demands your attention to the storyline and character interactions. While you can play while running or biking, you may find it challenging to fully appreciate the narrative if you're intensely focusing on your physical activity. Longer bouts of dialogue may create a situation where you need to pause your workout to make decisions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Disco Elysium is not one of the most graphically demanding games out there, meaning it's accessible for a wide range of computer specs. The Final Cut does come with some additional voice acting and cinematics that may require a bit more from your rig than the original release, but it's still not an aggressive title in terms of system requirements. A mid-range PC should handle it without issues, making it easy for players with different setups to join in.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Disco Elysium - The Final Cut is a beautifully crafted experience that offers a rich story and complex characters, but it's not without its pacing challenges during exercise. Its accessibility and controller support make it a viable option for using on a treadmill or bike, but you may need to balance your focus between gripping dialogue and your physical workout routine. The game shines in technical performance but may require some adaptation to keep you fully engaged during your sweat sessions.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3

If you're looking for a narrative-driven game to enjoy while exercising, Disco Elysium - The Final Cut offers a unique experience that can keep your mind engaged, just be prepared for the slower pacing that might shift your focus during those critical running or biking moments.
