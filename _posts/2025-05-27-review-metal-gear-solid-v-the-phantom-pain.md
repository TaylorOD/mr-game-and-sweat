# METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN Review

Hideo Kojima's magnum opus, METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN, is not just a narrative-driven experience but offers a tantalizing playground of stealth and action. Ideal for gamers looking to squeeze in some cardio during their gaming sessions, this title provides a unique blend of engagement and immersive gameplay.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in METAL GEAR SOLID V is both expansive and engaging, seamlessly blending stealth mechanics with open-world exploration. As you take on the role of Big Boss, your tactical choices greatly influence the outcome of missions, keeping you on the edge of your seat whether you're infiltrating enemy bases or rescuing hostages. The freedom to approach scenarios in various ways, combined with a robust set of tools and gadgets, ensures that there's always something exciting happening. 

Cutscenes are well-placed but can sometimes feel lengthy, offering lore-heavy storytelling that could potentially distract you from your workout. However, the game respects your time, with many missions designed to be completed in short bursts, making it easier to maintain focus on both your running or biking and the mission at hand.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with a treadmill or a bike, METAL GEAR SOLID V delivers quite well. The game is controller-friendly, so you can easily establish a comfortable setup, whether you're jogging or pedaling. The controls are intuitive, allowing you to navigate the game without requiring rapid twitch movements that might cause you to lose your stride. 

However, during intense stealth encounters, you may find yourself needing to remain still or low to the ground, which can sometimes pose a challenge for those wanting to keep the momentum going on a treadmill. Still, for the most part, you can maintain a steady pace while enjoying this thrilling adventure.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

METAL GEAR SOLID V does demand a fair bit from your computer, which is a consideration if you're looking to balance gaming with exercise. The minimum requirements aren't overly steep, but for an optimal experience, a decent graphics card and processor are recommended. If you're looking to run the game smoothly while also monitoring your workout metrics, ensure your rig is up to par. 

While it might not require the latest hardware, those looking to push the visuals will want to allocate some resources. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

In conclusion, METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN is an exhilarating gaming experience that suits those looking to stay active while immersing themselves in a rich narrative and tactical gameplay. Its engaging mechanics allow you to manage your exercise routine without losing focus on the mission, and with reasonable requirements on your hardware, it finds a comfortable balance. 

While not completely devoid of distractions, this game proves to be a worthy companion for your treadmill running or biking sessions.
