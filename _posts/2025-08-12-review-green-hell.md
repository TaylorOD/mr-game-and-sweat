# Game Review: Green Hell

**Gameplay**  
Green Hell offers a gripping survival experience set in the Amazon rainforest, where players take on the role of a stranded anthropologist. The focus on crafting, gathering resources, and surviving against the elements is both engaging and immersive. The game does a stellar job of creating tension, especially with its day-night cycles and unpredictable wildlife encounters. There are moments when players must strategize their next steps, ensuring their attention remains fixed on the game, which could potentially distract you from your treadmill or bike. However, while the gameplay flows well, there are a few slower sections, particularly during resource gathering and crafting, that might momentarily take away from the heart-pounding workout you’re aiming for. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

**Treadmill and Bike Compatibility**  
Green Hell supports controller compatibility, which adds to its accessibility for gamers looking to exercise simultaneously. However, the game requires a fair amount of precision in movements—especially during combat scenarios and while navigating treacherous terrains. The need to react quickly to threats or manage health and nutrition may hinder your ability to focus on a steady rhythm while running or biking. That said, if you maintain a moderate pace, the exploration and resource management can keep you engaged without too much jerky movement required.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

**Computer Requirements**  
Green Hell is relatively demanding, requiring a solid mid-range PC to run smoothly. The game boasts beautifully detailed graphics of its lush environment, but players will need a capable graphics card and a decent amount of RAM to avoid lag, particularly during intense moments. If your setup isn't up to par, your workout could become frustrating with unnecessary interruptions. It’s ideal to check the recommended specifications if you want to maintain a seamless gaming experience while exercising.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

**Conclusion and Score**  
Overall, Green Hell is an engaging survival experience with mechanics that can keep you invested and energized, ideal for a workout when the treadmill or bike can support a more steady pace. While not without its slower moments and mouse-and-keyboard precision requirements, it remains a compelling choice as long as you're mindful of your pace. Balancing survival tactics with your exercise routine, it’s likely you’ll find yourself sufficiently challenged both in-game and in your physical activity.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
