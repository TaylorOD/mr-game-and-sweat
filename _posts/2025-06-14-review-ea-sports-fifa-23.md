# EA SPORTS FIFA 23 Review

As a fitness enthusiast and avid gamer, I’ve been on the lookout for games that allow me to combine my love for exercise with engaging gameplay. “EA SPORTS FIFA 23” rose to the occasion, bringing a vibrant soccer experience right into my living room. How well does it hold up when paired with treadmill running or biking? Let's explore.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in FIFA 23 is as dynamic and rich as you'd expect from an annual installment of the franchise. The controls are responsive, and the flow of the matches keeps you engaged throughout. The ball physics and player movements have received notable upgrades, making in-game actions feel more realistic than ever. However, there are still moments that can slow the tempo, particularly during cut scenes and goal celebrations. These moments may disrupt your rhythm while exercising, but fortunately, they are brief and occur at intervals rather than being overly drawn out.

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

FIFA 23 shines in its compatibility with exercise routines. The game supports controller use without any requirements for rapid reflexes or twitch gaming, allowing players to maintain a steady pace on a treadmill or bike. You can easily control players' movements without needing to whip your fingers around too quickly or perform complicated maneuvers, which is a significant advantage during workouts. However, to maximize your exercise time, it’s wise to play in a mode where you can set the pace, such as Career Mode or offline matches, as opposed to online play which can lead to more stressful situations and require greater concentration.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

For those considering playing FIFA 23 on a computer, the system requirements are fairly demanding but manageable if you're gaming on a relatively recent setup. Recommended specs include an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5, 8GB RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7850. This level of performance ensures smooth gameplay, reducing lag and allowing you to enjoy the game fully while working up a sweat. However, those with lower-end setups might experience slower framerates which could disrupt the immersive experience.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Overall, “EA SPORTS FIFA 23” provides an exciting soccer simulation that can complement your treadmill or bike workouts. The fast-paced action and controller compatibility make it a suitable choice for those looking to stay active while enjoying a robust gaming experience. While longer cut scenes can occasionally disrupt your flow, the pros significantly outweigh the cons. If you have a decent gaming setup, you’ll find FIFA 23 to be an enjoyable addition to your exercise regime.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
