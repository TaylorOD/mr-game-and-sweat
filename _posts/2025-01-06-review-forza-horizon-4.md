# Forza Horizon 4 Review

Forza Horizon 4 takes players on an exhilarating open-world racing adventure through the picturesque landscapes of Britain. With its rich environments and diverse weather system, it sets a high bar for racing games. But how well does it cater to those who want to combine their gaming with a solid workout on a treadmill or bike? Let’s dive in.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Forza Horizon 4 is nothing short of addictive. The thrill of racing through changing seasons keeps it fresh and exciting, ensuring you're always engaged and on your toes. The game is packed with a variety of events, from circuit races to off-road challenges, which means there’s never a dull moment. Importantly, the pacing is top-notch—there are minimal slow sections or long cut scenes that could distract you. Instead, the game encourages you to jump right into the action, making it easy to maintain focus while you jog or cycle, seamlessly immersing you in the environment.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Forza Horizon 4 is remarkably compatible with both treadmill and bike setups. It supports controller inputs wonderfully, allowing you to use a gamepad while maintaining your footing on a treadmill or cycling. The control scheme is forgiving enough not to require rapid, jerky movements, which can be challenging while exercising. The game excels in this aspect, making it easy to enjoy high-octane racing without losing your balance or stability on your equipment. However, players should keep in mind that the occasional need for sharper steering can distract slightly, but it rarely disrupts the overall experience.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Forza Horizon 4 has moderate to high system requirements, depending on how graphically intensive you wish the experience to be. To enjoy the game at its best settings, a capable graphics card and a decent processor are essential. However, those with mid-range PCs can still enjoy satisfactory visual fidelity while keeping frame rates smooth. It is worth ensuring your setup is appropriate, especially if you plan on playing while simulating physical activity, as any lag could detract from the immersive experience.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Forza Horizon 4 manages to strike an impressive balance between exhilarating gameplay and compatibility with physical activity. Its engaging environment, minimal interruptions, and easy control scheme make it an excellent choice for those looking to get their heart rates up while cruising through a vivid virtual world. Although its computer requirements are a bit steep, the overall experience is so enjoyable that it’s well worth the investment. If you’re looking for a fun, interactive way to stay fit, this game is certainly a worthy contender.
