Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Detroit: Become Human,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Game Review: Detroit: Become Human

Detroit: Become Human is a visually stunning narrative-driven adventure game that immerses players in a futuristic world where androids grapple with their existence and strive for independence. As a title that combines storytelling with player choices, it's fascinating; but how does it fare when you’re trying to stay active on a treadmill or bike?

# Gameplay

Detroit: Become Human offers a richly woven narrative filled with engrossing plot twists and dynamic decision-making. However, be prepared for the numerous cutscenes and slower-paced interactions that punctuate the experience. While the choices are engaging, large portions of gameplay hinge on dialogue and exploration, which can pull focus from your exercise routine. If you’re hoping for a swift-paced experience to keep your heart rate up, you might find yourself occasionally drifting into inactive periods. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to playing while being active, Detroit: Become Human has mixed results. The game relies heavily on controller input, which is manageable; however, the nature of cutscenes and occasionally slow in-game interactions might require you to slow down your treadmill speed or ease up on cycling intensity to fully absorb the story. The quick-time events do require some dexterity, but the lack of frantic action means most players won’t need to pump the brakes often, making it relatively compatible with low to moderate exercise.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Detroit: Become Human is graphically intensive and demands a solid gaming rig to run smoothly. For optimal performance, you’ll need a dedicated graphics card, a decent CPU, and ample RAM. Therefore, if you're looking to engage in a gaming session while exercising, ensure your setup is up to par, or be prepared for sacrifices in visual fidelity. If your setup is lagging, it could distract you from focusing on your workout.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

Detroit: Become Human is a masterpiece in narrative design that offers a compelling experience, but it may not be the best choice for those trying to stay active while gaming. Its cutscenes and slower moments require a degree of attention that may disrupt your exercise flow. If you’re committed to immersing yourself in its story while keeping a chill-paced workout, it can be a decent option; just don’t expect a high-intensity experience.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
