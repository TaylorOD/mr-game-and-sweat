# Plague Inc: Evolved - Game Review

As a fitness and gaming enthusiast, I am always on the hunt for games that can keep the adrenaline pumping while allowing me to squeeze in cardio sessions. "Plague Inc: Evolved," a strategy simulation game where you design and evolve a pathogen to wipe out humanity, is an intriguing mix of strategy and dark humor that provides an engaging backdrop for your workouts. Let’s dive into the details!

# Gameplay

The core gameplay revolves around creating and evolving a virus, bacteria, or other pathogens with the goal of infecting and exterminating the global population. The game plays like a captivating puzzle where you balance infectivity, lethality, and resistance against global countermeasures. The real-time strategy element draws you in, requiring you to adapt quickly based on how the world responds to your efforts. 

I found that the game is quite engaging and mostly distraction-free—perfect for keeping your mind occupied while breaking a sweat on the treadmill or bike. There are no lengthy cutscenes; it's purely a strategic experience where your decisions determine the outcome. However, some turns can drag a bit if you’re caught waiting for the infection to spread, so pacing yourself is key—which is alright during a steady run, as it allows you to catch your breath.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

"Plague Inc: Evolved" sets itself apart with excellent controller compatibility. You can easily play it using Xbox or PlayStation controllers, allowing you to stay mobile while gaming during your exercise sessions. The controls are intuitive, requiring minimal quick reactions or twitch gameplay. You generally won’t be fumbling with inputs, making it a perfect game to play while maintaining focus on your workout.

The game does not require rapid movements or precise dexterity, meaning you can enjoy the strategic planning while keeping your heart rate up. Since it's primarily point-and-click, you can run or bike without hassle, making it an ideal companion on your fitness journey.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

"Plague Inc: Evolved" isn't too demanding on computer systems and runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware. You can expect it to perform well with lower-end specs, which is great if you’re gaming on a laptop while keeping your exercise equipment in the living space. The visuals are stylized, which helps ensure the game doesn’t require the latest graphics cards to function well. This lightweight nature allows you to focus more on your workout than on managing system requirements.

Overall, "Plague Inc: Evolved" is a compelling strategy game that successfully combines engaging gameplay with compatibility for exercise routines. It draws you in with its strategic depth, while the user-friendly mechanics ensure you won't be overly distracted from your workout.
