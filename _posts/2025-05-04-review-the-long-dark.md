The Long Dark is an atmospheric survival game set in the frigid wilderness of Canada, where you'll face the harsh elements as a pilot stranded after a mysterious geomagnetic disaster. As you navigate through an unforgiving landscape teeming with wildlife and harsh weather, the game's focus on realism and survival mechanics becomes both a challenge and a reward.

The game's pace is deliberate, allowing you to immerse yourself in the experience without overwhelming distractions.
