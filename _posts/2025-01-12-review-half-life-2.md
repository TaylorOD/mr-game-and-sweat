Half-Life 2 is a landmark title in the world of first-person shooters, offering a narrative-rich experience combined with innovative gameplay mechanics. It is not only a thrilling ride through a dystopian world but also a game that you can enjoy while getting your exercise in, as it lends itself well to playing on a treadmill or bike. 

# Gameplay

The gameplay in Half-Life 2 is masterfully crafted and incredibly engaging.

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Half-Life 2 proves to be a surprisingly compatible workout companion. The game allows for traditional controller setup, which is beneficial for maintaining the movement required for running or cycling. The controls are straightforward, but due to the nature of first-person shooters, there are instances where quick reactions may be needed—though not overwhelmingly so. You can easily adjust your speed and intensity while still keeping your engagement with the game, making it perfect for hour-long sessions on the treadmill or bike.

Most users today can easily meet or exceed its system requirements, which makes it an accessible title for a broad audience. The game runs smoothly across various systems, allowing for a seamless gaming experience that won’t detract from your cardio workout. 

### Category Score: 3 out of 3
