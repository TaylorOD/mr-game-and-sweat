# Gameplay

# DOOM Eternal Review

DOOM Eternal, the highly acclaimed sequel to 2016's DOOM, is a relentless, adrenaline-pumping FPS that not only challenges your gaming prowess but also provides a fantastic backdrop for your exercise routine. As we dive into various facets of the game, particularly how it integrates with treadmill or biking workouts, let’s see how well it holds up!

# Gameplay

From the moment you jump into DOOM Eternal, you’re plunged into a whirlwind of fast-paced action that rarely lets up. The game encourages you to constantly move, dodge, and engage in combat with a variety of demons, all while maintaining your momentum. The intense setup and exceptional gunplay create an engagement level that pulls you in, keeping your workout dynamic and adrenaline-fueled. There are minimal slow sections or long cutscenes to detract from your running or biking experience—each level is crafted to keep you on your toes (both literally and figuratively). You can easily lose track of time and distance as the action propels you forward, turning your workout into a thrilling combat experience.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

DOOM Eternal shines in terms of compatibility with treadmills and bikes. The gameplay’s design heavily revolves around fast movements, but you can adjust the game to fit your exercise routine comfortably. Using a controller, you can effectively manage your character's movements with your upper body while simultaneously keeping your legs engaged in cardio. The key here is to find a steady rhythm with the movement—which, thankfully, the game encourages with its relentless pace. Since there's no requirement for twitch reflexes that necessitate precise hand-eye coordination, you’re free to focus on your workout without the constant threat of failing an encounter.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

DOOM Eternal is visually breathtaking, but that stunning graphics powerhouse comes with a demand on your hardware. The game requires a decent setup, ideally a higher mid-range GPU and CPU to experience all the eye candy at smooth frame rates. So if you’re looking to fire up DOOM Eternal on an older machine, be prepared for some potential compromises in quality and performance. If you're coupling exercise with gaming, it's worth ensuring your setup is up to snuff to avoid disrupting your efforts mid-session.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, DOOM Eternal offers a high-octane gaming experience that's intensely engaging, perfect for those looking to sweat it out on their treadmill or bike while launching themselves into combat against iconic demons. The gameplay keeps you moving, making it remarkably compatible with exercise. However, just keep in mind the hardware demands—ensure your computer can handle the power that this game wields. 

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
