# Resident Evil 4 Game Review

Resident Evil 4, often hailed as one of the finest entries in the survival horror genre, manages to keep players engaged with its intense action and captivating storytelling. But how does it fare for those of us looking to squeeze in a good workout while enjoying our favorite games? Let’s break it down!

## Gameplay

In terms of engagement, Resident Evil 4 excels spectacularly. The game expertly blends fast-paced action with puzzle-solving, and the tension keeps you on edge. Every encounter with the grotesque Ganados draws you in, potentially distracting you just enough from tracking that pesky treadmill or keeping your bike's pedals moving. However, the game does feature a few slow sections and longer cutscenes that might pull you out of the rhythm of your workout if you're not careful. Luckily, the majority of gameplay moments are action-packed, which helps maintain your adrenaline and engagement during those high-energy intervals. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Resident Evil 4 has controller compatibility, meaning you can easily game while running or biking. The mechanics are intuitive, and you won't find yourself needing to make rapid, twitchy movements that could derail your workout. The shooting mechanics involve aiming and timing your shots rather than fast reflexes, allowing you to stay steady on the treadmill or bike. However, some quick-time events and the need to dodge incoming hazards may occasionally require a short burst of focus, potentially leading to a fumble in your stride. 

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

As for computer requirements, Resident Evil 4 is relatively forgiving. The game runs well on a wide range of hardware, making it accessible for most setups, whether you're gaming on a high-end rig or something more modest. It doesn’t demand high levels of processing power or memory, so you can enjoy your workout without worrying constantly about the game's performance affecting your session.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

In summary, Resident Evil 4 provides a thrilling experience with strong gameplay mechanics that can keep you entertained while you run or cycle. While there are moments of slower pacing, the thrilling action makes up for it, and its decent compatibility with workout regimens speaks to its design.
