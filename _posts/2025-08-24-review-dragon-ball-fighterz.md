Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "DRAGON BALL FighterZ,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Dragon Ball FighterZ Review

As an exercise enthusiast who loves the thrill of gaming, "Dragon Ball FighterZ" stands out as a prime candidate for those who want to combine fitness with fierce battles in the iconic Dragon Ball universe. Let’s dive into the components that make or break the experience, especially for those pumping out miles on the treadmill or cycling through challenging terrains.

# Gameplay

The gameplay in "Dragon Ball FighterZ" is fast-paced and electrifying. With its 2D fighting style, the game provides engaging battles that keep you on the edge of your virtual seat. The controls are responsive, and the combo system encourages experimentation, which can keep you distracted from just how hard you’re working on your treadmill or stationary bike. There’s a fair amount of action packed into the matches without excessive slow sections or lengthy cut scenes, which is a significant plus for maintaining your focus and heart rate. 

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

"Dragon Ball FighterZ" offers solid controller compatibility, which is essential for keeping your hands free while you’re immersed in your exercise routine. However, the game does require quick reflexes and some fast-paced movements to execute combos successfully. If you’re running at a high pace, even the slightest bump can throw off your precision. That said, for gamers who prefer a more moderate exercise pace, the game can work quite well by keeping your mind engaged while your body remains active.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

The game is moderately demanding, which is worth noting for those who are considering playing on their PC while running or biking. "Dragon Ball FighterZ" requires a decent graphics card to run smoothly, so make sure your system can handle the game without any stuttering. If you maintain the settings optimally, however, it shouldn’t over-tax most modern setups too much, allowing you to enjoy the game without constant interruptions.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In conclusion, "Dragon Ball FighterZ" brilliantly merges the high-octane action of fighting games with the potential for an engaging workout experience. Its fast-paced gameplay ensures you're constantly entertained, and the controller compatibility is a bonus for those exercising. However, those who run or cycle at intense speeds might find the quick-reflex demands slightly challenging. With a reassuring balance between performance and playability, this title is well-suited for gamers who love to stay active.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
