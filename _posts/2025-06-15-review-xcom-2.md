Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "XCOM 2,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# XCOM 2 Review

XCOM 2 is a tactical turn-based strategy game that tasks players with leading a resistance against an alien regime bent on controlling Earth. Its engaging mix of strategic planning, resource management, and combat makes it an enticing choice, but how does it fare for those looking to exercise while gaming? Let’s dive into each category.

# Gameplay

XCOM 2 offers a gripping narrative and plenty of tactical depth as you manage a squad of soldiers. The gameplay is marked by well-designed missions that challenge your strategic acumen and keep you on your toes. However, the game features long loading times and some sections that can feel slow with extensive dialogue and cutscenes, which might lead to a momentary distraction from your workout. That said, the turn-based nature allows for strategic thinking during breaks in your run, making it possible to keep your heart rate up while plotting your next move. If you can keep a good rhythm with your treadmill or bike, the decision-making moments might even serve as a welcome breather between rounds of intense aerobic activity.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

XCOM 2 is primarily controlled using a keyboard and mouse, which may not be ideal for a workout scenario. However, it does support controller inputs, making it relatively simple to adapt for use while biking or walking on a treadmill. The game isn’t overly reliant on quick reflexes or high-speed twitch gameplay, which is a significant advantage for maintaining your focus on your workout. You can take your time, strategizing each move at your own pace, so you won't be jostling or accidentally hitting the wrong commands as you exercise.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

XCOM 2 has moderate system requirements, making it accessible on a wide range of PCs. It necessitates at least an Intel Core 2 Duo or equivalent processor, 4 GB RAM, and a modest graphics card (like NVIDIA's GTX 460). However, for optimal performance, especially if you want to run at higher resolutions or with mods, you might want a more powerful machine. The game does run smoothly on lower settings, which means you can still enjoy it without requiring a gaming powerhouse, but players with lower-end setups may experience some lag during heavy action sequences.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

XCOM 2 is a captivating tactical experience that provides a great balance of strategic challenge and narrative immersion. While it has a few slower sections that could distract you from your treadmill or bike workout, it compensates well with its turn-based mechanics and controller support. An engaging choice for gamers who want to break a sweat while diving into a deep and compelling storyline, XCOM 2 proves that fitness and gaming can indeed go hand in hand.

### Overall Score: 2 out of 3
