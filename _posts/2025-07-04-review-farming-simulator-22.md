Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Farming Simulator 22,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Farming Simulator 22 Review

Farming Simulator 22 is a simulation game that invites players to cultivate their dream farms, but how does it stack up for those looking to keep moving on a treadmill or bike? Let’s dig into the various aspects of the game.

## Gameplay

The gameplay in Farming Simulator 22 is both engaging and immersive, allowing players to manage every facet of running a farm—from planting and harvesting crops to raising livestock and managing finances. Its open-world format and seasonal cycles mean you can keep busy with tasks, which keeps your mind occupied and your muscles moving if you're playing while exercising. While there are a few slower moments, like waiting for crops to grow or during some tutorial tips, these do not detract heavily from the overall experience. The absence of long cutscenes and the ability to multitask with minimal need for high-speed reactions allow it to fit seamlessly into your exercise routine.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

## Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

Farming Simulator 22 supports various controllers, making it compatible with your workout setup. The gameplay mechanics involve a mix of strategic planning and relaxed control, meaning it doesn’t require overly intense, fast twitch reactions that could hinder your exercise effectiveness. Most activities have a slow, methodical nature, which makes it easier to play while focusing on your workouts on a treadmill or bike. However, there are certain tasks, like navigating tight crowded areas with vehicles, where having a stable hands-on approach might require minimal but sporadic quick movements.

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

## Computer Requirements

Farming Simulator 22 isn't overly demanding in terms of hardware, meaning it can run on mid-range systems without issue. Minimum specifications are quite reasonable, allowing a wide range of players to enjoy it. The only caveat is that you may want a robust setup if you plan to run the game with high settings for a better visual experience—especially with large fields and numerous vehicles on-screen.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

## Conclusion and Score

Farming Simulator 22 is an unexpectedly suitable game for those who want to keep active when gaming. With engaging gameplay that doesn’t distract too much from running or biking, it's a perfect companion for your workouts. While it has a couple of minor drawbacks, its solid controller compatibility and moderate system requirements ensure that players can focus on fun, relaxing farming while they keep those legs moving.

### Overall Score: 2.33 out of 3
