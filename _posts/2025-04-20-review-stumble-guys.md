Welcome back to Mr. Game and Sweat! Today, we’re tackling "Stumble Guys,". Let's break it down according to our key criteria: gameplay engagement, treadmill and bike compatibility, and computer requirements.

# Gameplay

# Stumble Guys Review

Stumble Guys is a vibrant and zany multiplayer party game that thrusts players into chaotic obstacle courses, reminiscent of the popular genre made famous by shows like "Wipeout." With its colorful graphics and lighthearted gameplay, it's a game designed to entertain, but how well does it fit into an exercise routine when you're on a treadmill or biking? Let’s dive into the details.

# Gameplay

The gameplay of Stumble Guys is both fast-paced and addictive. Players navigate through a series of increasingly absurd obstacle courses, with plenty of platforming challenges and bizarre hazards. The action is continuous, keeping you engaged without lengthy cutscenes or slow sections. This aspect is perfect for those looking to maintain a good rhythm on their treadmill or bike; the quick rounds mean you can hop into and out of gameplay without losing momentum. However, the chaotic nature might occasionally pull your focus away from your workout, which could be a distraction for some. 

### Category Score: 2.5 out of 3

# Treadmill and Bike Compatibility

When it comes to compatibility with treadmills and bikes, Stumble Guys fares pretty well. The game allows for a controller, which can be easier to manage while you are in motion. The controls are straightforward and don’t require excessive rapid-fire inputs, which is a boon for maintaining your footing or balance while exercising. However, there are moments when quick movements are needed to dodge obstacles, so be prepared for a bit of challenge if you're trying to remain stable during intense sections. Overall, it strikes a decent balance but may not be perfect for everyone.

### Category Score: 2 out of 3

# Computer Requirements

Stumble Guys is not a graphically demanding game, which is excellent news for players concerned about their computer's capabilities. The game runs smoothly on minimal specs, making it accessible to a broader range of players, including those using older PCs. Players won't need to worry about having a powerful gaming rig to enjoy the fun, and this means you can focus more on exercising rather than technical requirements slowing you down.

### Category Score: 3 out of 3

# Conclusion and Score

In summary, Stumble Guys offers an engaging and entertaining experience that's perfect for gamers looking to combine fun with exercise. While it has its chaotic moments that could distract from your workout, the lighthearted gameplay and controller compatibility make it a reasonable choice for those using a treadmill or bike. Plus, its low system requirements ensure that almost anyone can join in on the fun without any technical hitches.

### Overall Score: 2.5 out of 3
